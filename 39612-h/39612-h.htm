<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The chief difficulty in writing a life of Sir Everard
Digby is to steer clear of the alternate dangers of
perverting it into a mere history of the Gunpowder
Plot, on the one hand, and of failing to say enough
of that great conspiracy to illustrate his conduct, on
the other. Again, in dealing with that plot, to condemn
all concerned in it may seem like kicking a
dead dog to Protestants, and to Catholics like joining
in one of the bitterest and most irritating taunts to
which they have been exposed in this country
throughout the last three centuries. Nevertheless,
I am not discouraged. The Gunpowder Plot is an
historical event about which the last word has not
yet been said, nor is likely to be said for some time
to come; and monographs of men who were, either
directly or indirectly, concerned in it, may not be
altogether useless to those who desire to make a
study of it. However faulty the following pages
may be in fact or in inference, they will not have
been written in vain if they have the effect of
eliciting from others that which all students of
historical subjects ought most to desire&mdash;the Truth.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge most valuable assistance<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
received from the Right Rev. Edmund Knight,
formerly Bishop of Shrewsbury, as well as from
the Rev. John Hungerford Pollen, S.J., who was
untiring in his replies to my questions on some
very difficult points; but it is only fair to both
of them to say that the inferences they draw from
the facts, which I have brought forward, occasionally
vary from my own. My thanks are also due
to that most able, most courteous, and most patient
of editors, Mr Kegan Paul, to say nothing of his
services in the very different capacity of a publisher,
to Mr Wynne of Peniarth, for permission to photograph
his portrait of Sir Everard Digby, and to Mr
Walter Carlile for information concerning Gayhurst.</p>

<p>The names of the authorities of which I have made
most use are given in my footnotes; but I am perhaps
most indebted to one whose name does not appear
the oftenest. The back-bone of every work dealing
with the times of the Stuarts must necessarily be the
magnificent history of Mr Samuel Rawson Gardiner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>Nothing is so fatal to the telling of an anecdote as
the prelude:&mdash;&#8220;I once heard an amusing story,&#8221;&amp;c.,
and it would be almost as unwise to begin a biography
by stating that its subject was a very interesting
character. On the other hand, perhaps I may frighten
away readers by telling them at starting, this simple
truth, that I am about to write the history of a young
man of great promise, whose short life proved a
miserable failure, who terribly injured the cause he
had most at heart, for which he gave his life, a
man of whom even his enemies said, when he had
met his sad fate:&mdash;&#8220;Poor fellow. He deserved it.
But what a pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>If the steady and unflinching gaze of one human
being upon another can produce the hypnotic state,
it may be that, in a much lesser degree, there is
some subtle influence in the eternal stare of the
portrait of an ancestor. There is no getting away
from it unless you leave the room. If you look at
your food, talk to a friend, or read a book, you know
and feel that his eyes are still rivetted upon you; and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>
if you raise your own, again, towards his, there he is,
gravely and deliberately gazing at you, or, you are
half inclined to think, <i>through</i> you at something beyond
and behind you, until you almost wish that
you could be thrown into some sort of cataleptic
condition, in which a series of scenes could be brought
before your vision from the history of the long-dead
man, whose representation seems only to exist for the
purpose of staring you out of countenance.</p>

<p>In a large country house, near the west coast
of Wales, and celebrated for its fine library, hangs
a full-length portrait which might well impel such
a desire. It represents a tall man, with long hair
and a pointed beard, in a richly-chased doublet,
a lace ruff and cuffs, very short and fringed trunk
hose, and a sword by his side. He has a high
forehead, rather raised and arched eyebrows, a
long nose, hollow cheeks, and a narrow, pointed
chin. His legs are thin; his left hand is placed
upon his hip; and with his right he holds a cane,
which is resting on the ground. At the bottom
of the picture is painted, in Roman characters,
&#8220;Sir Everard Digby, Knight, <span class="smcap lowercase">OB.</span> 1606.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few people care for genealogies unless their own
names are recorded in them. The keenest amateur
herald in matters relating to his own family, will
exhibit an amazing apathy when the pedigree of
another person is offered for his inspection; the
shorter, therefore, my notice of Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
descent, the better. He was descended from a
distinguished family. It had come over from
Normandy with William the Conqueror, who had
granted it lands at Tilton, which certainly were
in its possession in the sixteenth century, though
whether the subject of my biography inherited them,
I am not quite sure. The first Sir Everard Digby
lived in the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This
powerful family sided with Henry VII. against
Richard III.; and on one occasion, King Henry
VII.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &#8220;did make Knights in the field seven brothers
of his house at one time, from whom descended
divers houses of that name, which live all in good
reputation in their several countries. But this Sir
Everard Digby was the heir of the eldest and chiefest
house, and one of the chiefest men in Rutlandshire,
where he dwelt, as his ancestors had done before
him, though he had also much living in Leicestershire
and other shires adjoining.&#8221;He was the
fourteenth in direct eldest male descent from Almar,
the founder of the family in the eleventh century.
Five of his forefathers had borne the name of Everard
Digby, one of whom was killed at the battle of
Towton in 1461. Sir Everard&#8217;s father had also
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>been an Everard, and done honour to the name;
but literature and not war had been the field in
which he had succeeded. He published four books.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The only one of these in my possession is his
<i>Dissuasive from taking the Goods and Livings of
the Church</i>. It is dedicated &#8220;To the Right Honourable
Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord High Chancellor
of England, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>The author&#8217;s style may be inferred from the
opening of his preface:&mdash;&#8220;If my pen (gentle reader)
had erst bin dipped in the silver streames flowing
from Parnassus Hill, or that Apollo with his sweet-sounding
harp would vouchsafe to direct the passage
thereof unto the top of the high Olympus; after so
general a view of great varietie far and neere, I might
bouldly begin with that most excellent Poet Cicelides
Mus&#281; paulo maiora canamus.&#8221;I leave my readers to
judge how many modern publishers would read any
further, if such a book were offered to them in these
days! Still, it is interesting as showing the style of
the times.</p>

<p>Father Gerard, an intimate friend of the Sir Everard
Digby whose life I am writing, mentions<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &#8220;the
piety of his parents,&#8221;and that &#8220;they were ever the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>most noted and known Catholics in that country&#8221;
(Rutlandshire); and Mr Gillow, in his <i>Bibliographical
Dictionary of English Catholics</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, states that they
&#8220;had ever been the most staunch and noted Catholics
in the county of Rutland.&#8221;But here I am met with
a difficulty. Would a Catholic have written such a
passage as the following, which I take from the
<i>Dissuasive</i>? It refers to that great champion of
Protestantism and Anglicanism, Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot but write truely,&#8221;he says, &#8220;that which
the Clergie with the whole realme confesse plainely:
That we render immortell thankes unto Almightie
God, for preserving her most Roiall Majestie so
miraculouslie unto this daie, giving her a most religious
heart (the mirror of all Christian princes) once and
ever wholly consecrated to the maintaining of his
divine worship in his holy Temple. From this cleare
Christall fountaine of heavenlie vertue, manie silver
streames derive their sundrie passages so happelie into
the vineyarde of the Lorde, that neither the flaming
fury of outward enimies, nor the scorching sacrilegious

<p>The writer of the notice of Sir Everard Digby in
the <i>Biographia Britannica</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> appears to have believed
his father to have been a Protestant; but on
what grounds he does not state. So familiar a friend
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>as Father Gerard is unlikely to have been mistaken
on this point. Possibly, however, in speaking of
his &#8220;parents,&#8221;he may have meant his forefathers
rather than his own father and mother. This seems
the more likely because, after his father&#8217;s death,
when he was eleven years old, Sir Everard was
brought up a Protestant. In those times wards
were often, if not usually, educated as Protestants,
even if their fathers had been Catholics; but if
Sir Everard&#8217;s mother had been remarkable for her
&#8220;piety&#8221;as a Catholic, and one of the &#8220;noted and
known Catholics&#8221;in her county, we might expect
to find some record of her having endeavoured to
induce her son to return to the faith of his father,
as she lived until after his death. The article in the
<i>Biographia</i> states that Sir Everard was &#8220;educated
with great care, but under the tuition of some Popish
priests&#8221;: Father Gerard, on the contrary, says that
he &#8220;was not brought up Catholicly in his youth,
but at the University by his guardians, as other
young gentlemen used to be&#8221;; and in his own <i>Life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
he speaks of him as a Protestant after his marriage.
Lingard also says<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that &#8220;at an early age he was
left by his father a ward of the crown, and had in
consequence been educated in the Protestant faith.&#8221;
I can see no reason for doubting that this was the
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></p><p>At a very early age, Everard Digby was taken
to the Court of Queen Elizabeth, where he became
&#8220;a pensioner,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or some sort of equivalent to what
is now termed a Queen&#8217;s page. He must have
arrived at the Court about the time that Essex was
in the zenith of his career; he may have witnessed
his disgrace and Elizabeth&#8217;s misery and vacillation
with regard to his trial and punishment. He would
be in the midst of the troubles at the Court, produced
by the rivalry between Sir Walter Raleigh
and Sir Charles Blount; he would see his relative,
Cecil, rapidly coming into power; he could scarcely
fail to hear the many speculations as to the successor
of his royal mistress.</p>

<p>He may have accompanied her<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> &#8220;hunting and
disporting&#8221;&#8220;every other day,&#8221;and seen her &#8220;set upon
jollity&#8221;; he may have enjoyed the<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> &#8220;frolyke&#8221;in
&#8220;courte, much dauncing in the privi chamber of
countrey daunces befor the Q. M.&#8221;; very likely he
may have been in attendance upon the Queen when
she walked on<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> &#8220;Richmond Greene,&#8221;&#8220;with greater
shewes of ability, than&#8221;could &#8220;well stand with her
years.&#8221;During the six years that he was at Court,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>he probably came in for a period of brilliancy and
a period of depression, although there is nothing to
show for certain whether he had retired before the
time thus described in an old letter<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;Thother
of the counsayle or nobilitye estrainge themselves
from court by all occasions, so as, besides the master
of the horse, vice-chamberlain, and comptroller, few
of account appeare there.&#8221;If Lingard is right,
however,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> he gave up his appointment at Court the
year before Elizabeth&#8217;s death, and thus luckily
escaped the time when, as he describes her, she
was<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> &#8220;reduced to a skeleton. Her food was nothing
but manchet bread and succory pottage. Her taste
for dress was gone. She had not changed her clothes
for many days. Nothing could please her; she was
the torment of the ladies who waited on her person.
She stamped with her feet, and swore violently at
the objects of her anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing that may have had a subsequent influence
upon Digby, while he was at the Court of Elizabeth,
was the violence shown towards Catholics. In the
course of the fourteen years that followed the defeat
of the Spanish Armada before the death of the Queen,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
&#8220;the Catholics groaned under the presence of incessant
persecution. Sixty-one clergymen, forty-seven laymen,
and two gentlemen, suffered capital punishment
for some or other of the spiritual felonies and treasons
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>which had been lately created.&#8221;Although he had
been brought up a Protestant, &#8220;this gentleman,&#8221;says
Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> &#8220;was always Catholicly affected,&#8221;and the
severe measures dealt out to Catholics whilst he was
at Court may have disgusted him and induced him to
leave it.</p>

<p>I have shown how Father Gerard states<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that Sir
Everard Digby was educated &#8220;at the University by
his guardians, as other young gentlemen used to be.&#8221;
It is to be wished that he had informed us at what
University and at what College; when he went there
and when he left; as his attendance at Court, together
with a very important event, to be noticed presently,
which took place, or is said to have taken place, when
he was fifteen, make it difficult to allot a vacant time
for his University career.</p>

<p>The young man,&mdash;he did not live to be twenty-five,&mdash;whose
portrait we have been looking at, is described
in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as having been &#8220;remarkably
handsome,&#8221;&#8220;extremely modest and affable,&#8221;
and &#8220;justly reputed one of the finest gentlemen in
England.&#8221;His great personal friend, the already-quoted
Father Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> says that he was &#8220;as complete
a man in all things that deserved estimation, or might
win him affection, as one should see in a kingdom.
He was of stature about two yards high,&#8221;&#8220;of countenance&#8221;
&#8220;comely and manlike.&#8221;&#8220;He was skilful in all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>things that belonged to a gentleman, very cunning at
his weapon, much practised and expert in riding of great
horses, of which he kept divers in his stable with a
skilful rider for them. For other sports of hunting or
hawking, which gentlemen in England so much use
and delight in, he had the best of both kinds in
the country round about.&#8221;&#8220;For all manner of games
which are also usual for gentlemen in foul weather,
when they are forced to keep house, he was not only
able therein to keep company with the best, but was
so cunning in them all, that those who knew him well,
had rather take his part than be against him.&#8221;&#8220;He
was a good musician, and kept divers good musicians
in his house; and himself also could play well of
divers instruments. But those who were well acquainted
with him&#8221;&mdash;and no one knew him better
than Father Gerard himself&mdash;&#8220;do affirm that in gifts
of mind he excelled much more than in his natural
parts; although in those also it were hard to find so
many in one man in such a measure. But of wisdom
he had an extraordinary talent, such a judicial wit
and so well able to discern and discourse of any matter,
as truly I have heard many say they have not seen the
like of a young man, and that his carriage and manner
of discourse were more like to a grave Councillor of State
than to a gallant of the Court as he was, and a man
of about twenty-six years old (which I think was his
age, or thereabouts).&#8221;In this Father Gerard was mistaken.
Sir Everard Digby did not live to be twenty-<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>six,
or even twenty-five. Gerard continues:&mdash;&#8220;And
though his behaviour were courteous to all, and
offensive to none, yet was he a man of great courage
and of noted valour.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">GOTHURST<br />
<i>The home of Sir Everard Digby; now called Gayhurst</i></p>

<p>We began by examining a portrait: let us now
take a look at an old country-house. Turning our
backs on Wales, a country which has little to do
with my subject, we will imagine ourselves in
Buckinghamshire, about half way between the towns
of Buckingham and Bedford, and about three miles
from Newport Pagnell, a little way from the high
road leading in a north-westerly direction. There
stands the now old, but at the time of which I am
writing, the comparatively new house, known then
as Gothurst.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the chief attractions in Elizabethan
architecture is that, by combining certain features
of both classical and gothic architecture, it is a result,
as well as an example, of that spirit of compromise
so dear to the English nation. If somewhat less
picturesque, and less rich and varied in colour, than
the half-timbered houses of Elizabethan architecture,
the stone buildings of the same style are more
massive and stately in their appearance, and the
newly-hewn stone of Gothurst<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> presented a remarkably
fine front, with its pillared porch, its lengthy
series of mullioned windows, and its solid wings at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>either side. It was built upon rising ground, which
declined gradually to the rich, if occasionally marshy,
meadows bordering on the river Ouse.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was a
large house, although, like many others built in the
same style, the rooms were rather low in proportion
to their size.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The approach was through a massive
gateway,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> from which an avenue of yews&mdash;which
had existed in the time of the older house that
formerly stood on the same site&mdash;led up to the
square space in front of the door. Near the gateway
was the old church, which was then in a very
indifferent state of repair,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and below this were three
pieces of water. Beyond them ran the river Ouse,
and on the opposite side stood the old tower and
church of Tyringham. If the house was new, it
was very far from being the pretentious erection of
a newly-landed proprietor. Yet the estate on which
it stood had more than once been connected with a
new name, owing to failures in the male line of its
owners and the marriages of its heiresses, since it
had been held by a De Nouers, under the Earl of
Kent, half-brother to William the Conqueror. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>had passed<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> by marriage to the De Nevylls in 1408;
it had passed in the same way to the Mulshos in the
reign of Henry VIII., and I am about to show that,
at the end of the sixteenth century, it passed again
into another family through the wedding of its heiress.</p>

<p>Mary Mulsho, the sole heiress of Gothurst, was a
girl of considerable character, grace, and gravity of
mind, and she was well suited to become the bride of
the young courtier, musician, and sportsman excelling
&#8220;in gifts of mind,&#8221;described at the beginning of this
chapter. It can have been no marriage for the sake
of money or lands; for Everard Digby was already a
rich man, possessed of several estates, and he had had a
long minority; moreover, there is plenty of evidence to
show that they were devotedly attached to one another.</p>

<p>The exact date of their marriage I am unable to
give. Jardine says<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> that Sir Everard &#8220;was born in
1581,&#8221;and that &#8220;in the year 1596 he married&#8221;; and,
if this was so, he can have been only fifteen on his
marriage. Certainly he was very young at the time,
and Jardine may be right; for, at the age of twenty-four,
he said that a certain event, which is known to
have taken place some time after their marriage, had
happened seven or eight years earlier than the time at
which he was speaking.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I have made inquiries in
local registers and at the Herald&#8217;s College, without
obtaining any further light upon the question of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>exact date of his wedding. One thing is certain, that
his eldest son, Kenelm, was born in the year 1603.
In that same year Everard Digby was knighted by
the new king, James I. He may have been young to
receive that dignity; but, as a contemporary writer<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
puts it, &#8220;at this time the honour of knighthood, which
antiquity preserved sacred, as the cheapest and readiest
jewel to preserve virtue with, was promiscuously laid
on any head belonging to the yeomandry (made addle
through pride and contempt of their ancestors&#8217;
pedigree), that had but a court-friend, or money to
purchase the favour of the meanest able to bring him
into an outward room, when the king, the fountain
of honour, came down, and was uninterrupted by other
business; in which case it was then usual for the
chamberlain or some other lord to do it.&#8221;It is said
that, during the first three months of the reign of
James I., the honour of knighthood was conferred upon
seven hundred individuals.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>We find Sir Everard and Lady Digby, at this period
of our story, possessed of everything likely to insure
happiness&mdash;mutual affection, youth, intelligence,
ability, popularity, high position, favour at Court,
abundance of wealth, and a son and heir. How far
this brilliant promise of happiness was fulfilled will be
seen by and bye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Young as he was, Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s acquaintance
was large and varied, and Gothurst was a very
hospitable house. Its host&#8217;s tastes enabled him
thoroughly to enjoy the society of his ordinary
country neighbours, whose thoughts chiefly lay in
the direction of sports and agriculture; but he still
more delighted in conversing with literary and contemplative
men, and when his guests combined all
these qualities, he was happiest. One such, who
frequently stayed at Gothurst, is thus quaintly
described by Father Gerard.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Roger Lee &#8220;was a
gentleman of high family, and of so noble a character
and such winning manners that he was a universal
favourite, especially with the nobility, in whose
company he constantly was, being greatly given to
hunting, hawking, and all other noble sports. He
was, indeed, excellent at everything, &amp;c.&#8221;In short,
he appears to have been exactly the kind of man
to make a congenial companion for Sir Everard.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>So intimate was he at Gothurst, even during the
life of Lady Digby&#8217;s father, who had died at the
time of which I am about to write, that, on his visits
there, he frequently took with him a friend, who,
like himself, was an intelligent, highly-educated, and
agreeable man, of good family, fond of hawking,
hunting, and other sports, and an excellent card-player.</p>

<p>Both Lee and his companion were Catholics, and,
as I explained in the last chapter, Sir Everard Digby,
although brought up a Protestant, was &#8220;Catholickly
inclined, and entertained no prejudice whatever against
those of the ancient faith&#8221;; indeed, in one of his conversations
with Lee he went so far as to ask him
whether he thought his friend would be a good
match for his own sister, observing that he would
have no objection to her marrying a Catholic; &#8220;for
he looked on Catholics as good and honourable men.&#8221;
Considering the pains, penalties, and disabilities to
which recusants, as they were called, were then exposed,
this meant very much more than a similar
remark would mean in our times. And not only
was he unprejudiced, for he took a keen interest
in the religion of Catholics, and the three men talked
frequently on that subject, the speakers being usually
Lee and Digby, the friend putting in a word occasionally,
but for the most part preferring to stand by as
a listener.</p>

<p>None of Lady Digby&#8217;s family were Catholics;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>father had been an ardent Protestant, and possibly,
as is not uncommonly the case, the long conversations
about Catholicism would have more interest to one
who had been brought up in an extreme Protestant
atmosphere, than to those who had been accustomed
to mix among people of both religions. At any rate,
it is pretty evident that the young wife often sat by
while her husband and his guests talked theology,
and that she had gradually begun to form her own
ideas upon the subject.</p>

<p>In considering life at a hospitable country house,
nearly three hundred years ago, it is well to try to
realise the difference between the conditions under
which guests can now be obtained and those then
existing. Visitors, and letters to invite them, are
now conveyed by railway, and our postal arrangements
are admirable; then, the public posts were very
slow and irregular, many of the roads were what
we should call mere cart-tracks, and it took weeks
to perform journeys which can now be accomplished
in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Our present system of filling our country houses
just when we please, and then taking a quiet time
alone, or visiting at other country houses, or betaking
ourselves to some place for amusement, was impossible
early in the seventeenth century; at that period, the
only chance of seeing friends, except those living
close at hand, was to receive them whenever they
found it convenient to come, and to make country<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
houses, as it were, hotels for such acquaintances who
chanced to be passing near them on their journeys.
People who were on visiting terms not uncommonly
rode or drove up to each other&#8217;s houses, without
special invitation; and, even when invited, if the
distance were great, owing to the condition of the
roads and the frequent breakdowns in the lumbersome
vehicles, it rarely could be foreseen when a destination
would be reached. Yet a welcome was generally
pretty certain, for, before the days of newspapers, to
say nothing of circulating libraries, hosts and hostesses
were not hypercritical of the guests who might come
to relieve their dulness, and the vestiges still remaining
of the feudal hospitality of the baron&#8217;s great halls
made them somewhat liberal and unfastidious as to
the social standing of those whom they received; nor
was it very rare for unknown travellers, who asked
leave to take a short rest at a strange house, to meet
with a cordial welcome and liberal entertainment.</p>

<p>There was nothing out of the common, therefore,
in guests so well known at Gothurst as Roger Lee
and his favourite companion riding up to that house
unexpected, yet certain of being gladly received; but,
on a certain occasion, they were both disappointed
on reaching its arched and pillared doorway, at being
told that their host had gone to London. The kind
and graceful reception given by their hostess, however,
did much to make up for his absence.</p>

<p>The long, if rather low rooms, with their wide,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
mullioned windows, the good supply, for those times,
of books, and the picturesque grounds, with the river
flowing through them, made Gothurst a charming
house to stay at, and Sir Everard&#8217;s man-cook<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> no
doubt made the creature comforts all that could be
desired. For those who cared for sport, there was
plenty of agreeable occupation, for there were hawks
and hounds and well-filled stables. The young
hostess, who had been brought up among men who
spent their lives in country amusements, could converse
about horses, dogs, and hunting if required;
most probably, too, she often carried a hawk on her
wrist; and, as she shared her husband&#8217;s tastes for
literature and serious reflection, she could suit herself
to almost any company.</p>

<p>Her two guests were prepared to talk about any
topic that might seem most pleasing to their hostess,
and it was soon clear that she wished to renew the
conversations about religion which she had listened
to with so much attention when her friends had been
last in her house in the company of her husband.
They were no less ready to discuss the same subject
with her, and the more she listened to them, the more
she questioned them, and the more she thought over
their replies to her difficulties, doubts, and objections,
the more inclination did she feel towards the creed they
professed. She was well aware that her husband, at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>the very least, had a high respect for it; that he
already admitted the truth of a great part of it, and
that, in discussing it with Lee and his friend, he had
propounded arguments against it rather as those of
others than as his own; and when, after considerable
solitary reflection while her visitors were out of doors,
she felt very nearly assured that the Almighty could
not approve of people professing a variety of creeds;
that of several religions, all teaching different doctrines,
only one could be right; that if God had revealed a
right religion, he must have ordained some one body
of men to teach it, and that there was only one body
which seemed to have any claim to such tremendous
authority, and that the Roman Catholic Church.
These thoughts made her earnestly wish to talk the
matter over with one of its priests, and consult him
on the question of her own position in respect to so
all-important a subject.</p>

<p>To meet with a priest was not easy in those times.
Such priests as there were in England rarely, if ever,
declared themselves, except to Catholics or would-be
Catholics; for to make such a declaration, in this
country, amounted to self-accusation of the crime of
High Treason. Her two guests were Catholics, and
would undoubtedly know several priests, and where
they could be found; but to reveal their names or their
whereabouts would be dangerous, both to those priests
and to themselves, and Lady Digby felt some hesitation
in interrogating them on such points. At last,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
rather than place one of her husband&#8217;s favourite companions
in a position which might be unwelcome or
even compromising, she determined to consult, not
Roger Lee, but the friend he had brought with him.
When she had delicately and nervously told him of
her wish to see a priest, she was far from reassured by
observing that he was with difficulty repressing a
smile.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Could it be that he thought her a silly woman,
hurriedly contemplating a change of religion on too
scanty consideration? Or was the finding of a priest
so difficult a thing just then as to make a wish to
attempt it absurd? His expression, however, soon
changed, and he told her, gravely enough, that he
thought her desire might very possibly be fulfilled;
at any rate, he promised to speak to Roger Lee about
it. &#8220;In the meantime,&#8221;he added, &#8220;I can teach you
the way to examine your conscience, as I myself was
taught to do it by an experienced priest.&#8221;She was
inclined to smile, in her turn, at such an offer from a
mere sportsman; so, thanking him, she allowed the
subject to drop.</p>

<p>He had not left her very long before Roger Lee
entered the room, and, as he immediately told her
that he had heard of her wish to have some conversation
with a priest, it was clear that his friend
had lost no time in informing him of it. Her
surprise may be imagined when Lee proceeded to
tell her that his companion was himself a priest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>At first she refused to believe it.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> &#8220;How is it
possible he can be a priest?&#8221;she asked, &#8220;has he
not lived rather as a courtier? Has he not played
cards with my husband, and played well too, which
is impossible for those not accustomed to the game?
Has he not gone out hunting, and frequently in my
hearing spoken of the hunt, and of hawks in proper
terms, without tripping, which no one could but
one who has been trained to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave many other reasons for disbelieving that
he could be a cleric; and, finally, only accepted the
fact on Roger Lee&#8217;s reiterated and solemn assurances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you,&#8221;she then said, &#8220;not to be angry
with me, if I ask further whether any other Catholic
knows him to be a priest but you. Does ...
know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;replied Lee, &#8220;and goes to confession to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she asked the same question concerning
several other Catholics living in the county, or
the adjoining counties&mdash;among others, a lady who
lived about ten miles from Gothurst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221;said Lee, &#8220;she not only knows him as
a priest, but has given herself, and all her household,
and all that she has, to be directed by him,
and takes no other guide but him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, she admitted that she was thoroughly
satisfied. Whereupon Lee remarked of his friend&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will find him, however, quite a different man
when he has put off his present character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221;wrote the priest himself, who was Father
John Gerard, second son of<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Sir Thomas Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
a Lancashire Knight, and an ancestor of the present
Lord Gerard. &#8220;This she acknowledged the next
day, when she saw me in my soutane and other
priestly garments, such as she had never before
seen. She made a most careful confession, and
came to have so great an opinion of my poor
powers, that she gave herself entirely to my direction,
meditated great things, which, indeed, she
carried out, and carries out still.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can fancy certain people, on reading all this,
saying, &#8220;How very underhand!&#8221;I would ask them
to bear in mind that for Father Gerard to have acted
otherwise, and to have gone about in &#8220;priestly
garments,&#8221;under his own name, would have been
the same thing as to have gone to the common hangman
and to have asked him to be so obliging as to put
the noose round his neck, and then to cut him down
as quickly as possible in order that he might relish
to the full the ghastly operation of disembowelling
and quartering. To this it may be replied that to
conceal his identity might be all very well, but that
it was quite another thing to stay at the house of a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>friend under that concealment, and, in the character
of a layman and a guest, to decoy his host&#8217;s wife
from her husband&#8217;s religion, in that host&#8217;s and
husband&#8217;s absence, thus betraying his friendship and
violating his hospitality.</p>

<p>My counter-reply would be, that his host had frequently
discussed religious questions with both himself
and Lee, and had shown, at least, a very friendly
feeling towards Catholics in general and their religion;
that, as has already been proved, he had in so many
words declared himself free from any objection to the
marriage of his own sister with a Catholic; nay,
that he wished to see her<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> &#8220;married well, and to a
Catholic, for he looked on Catholics as honourable
men;&#8221;and that Lady Digby had determined to
become a Catholic after due consideration and without
any unfair external influence. As to his revealing
his priestly character to her and exercising his
priestly functions on her behalf, it must be observed
that she had expressed a particular wish to see and
to converse with a priest, without any such action
on her part having been suggested to her by either
Gerard or Lee, and that, if Gerard had continued to
conceal his own priesthood, she would have simply
been put to the trouble, and possibly the dangers,
of searching for some other priest. If it be further
objected that he ought at least to have waited until
her husband&#8217;s return, I must so far repeat myself as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>to point out that a man who had stated that he
would have no objection whatever to his sister&#8217;s
being married to a Catholic, might be fairly assumed
to have no objection to finding himself also married
to a Catholic. Again, since Lady Digby was convinced
that her soul would only be safe when in
the fold of the Church, it would be natural that
she should not like to admit of any delay in her
reception into it. This being the case, the guests
had their duties to their hostess, as well as to their
host. It is unnecessary to enter here into the
question whether wives should inform their husbands,
and grown-up sons and daughters their parents,
before joining the Roman Catholic Church; I may,
however, be allowed to say that I believe it to be
the usual opinion of priests, as well as laymen, as it
certainly is of myself, that in most cases, although
possibly not absolutely in every case, their doing so
is not only desirable, but a duty, provided no hindrance
to the following of the dictates of their consciences
will result from so doing. Where it would
have such an effect, our Lord&#8217;s teaching is plain and
unmistakeable&mdash;&#8220;He that loveth father or mother
more than me, is not worthy of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some Protestants are under the impression that a
conversion like Lady Digby&#8217;s, in which she consulted,
and was received into the Church by, a &#8220;priest in
disguise&#8221;is &#8220;just the sort of thing that Roman
Catholics like.&#8221;There could be no greater mistake!<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
It is just what they do not like. The secrecy of
priests in the reign of James I. was rendered necessary
by persecution: so was that of the laity in housing
and entertaining them: so also were the precautions
to conceal the fact that mass was said in private
houses, and that rooms were used as chapels.</p>

<p>Now I would not pretend for a moment that such
a condition of things was wholesome for either priests,
Jesuits, laymen, or laywomen. There are occasions
on which secrecy may be a dire necessity, but it is,
at best, a necessary evil, and its atmosphere is
unnatural, cramping, dangerous, and demoralising,
although the persecution producing it may lead to
virtue, heroism, and even martyrdom. The persecutions
of the early Christians by the Romans gave
the Church hundreds of saints and martyrs; yet
surely those persecutions did not directly tend to the
welfare of Christianity; and I suppose that the
authorities of the established Church in this country
would scarcely consider that Anglicanism would be
in a more wholesome condition if every diocese and
cure were to be occupied by a bishop or priest of the
Church of Rome under the authority of the Pope,
although the privations of the dispossessed Anglican
clergy, and the inconveniences of the Anglican laity,
might be the means of bringing about many individual
instances of laudable self-denial, personal piety, and
religious zeal. On the same principle, I think that a
Catholic student, with an elementary knowledge of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
subject, when approaching the history of his co-religionists
in England during the reign of James I.,
would have good grounds for expecting that, while
many cases of valiant martyrdom and suffering for
the faith would embellish the pages he was about to
read, those pages would also reveal that the impossibility
of priests and religious living a clerical life, and
the necessity of their joining day by day in the pursuits
and amusements of laymen&mdash;laymen, often, of gaiety
and fashion, if nothing more&mdash;had led to serious irregularities
in discipline; that the frequent intervals without
mass, or any other religious service or priestly
assistance, had had the effect of rendering the laity
deficient in the virtues which religious exercises and
sacraments are supposed to inculcate; that the constant
and inevitable practice of secrecy and concealment had
induced a habit of mind savouring of prevarication, if
not of deception, and that in the embarrassing circumstances
and among the harassing surroundings of their
lives, clergy as well as laity had occasionally acted with
neither tact nor discretion. No one is more alive to
the sufferings or the injustices endured by English
Catholics in the early part of the seventeenth century,
or more admires the courage and patience shown by
many, if not most, of those who bore them, than myself;
and it is only in fairness to those sufferers, and
with a desire to look at their actions honestly, and, as
much as may be, impartially, that I approach the
subject in this spirit. I have laid the more emphasis<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
on the dangers of secrecy, be it ever so unavoidable or
enforced, because of their bearing upon a matter which
will necessarily figure largely in the forthcoming
pages.</p>

<p>Lady Digby had no sooner been received into the
Church than she became exceedingly anxious for the
conversion of her husband, but news now arrived
which made her anxious about him on another account.
A messenger brought the tidings that Sir Everard was
very seriously ill in London, and Lady Digby at once
determined to start on the journey of some forty-five
or fifty miles in order to nurse him. Her guests
volunteered to go to him also, and they were able to
accomplish the distance, over the bad roads of that
period, much more rapidly than she was.</p>

<p>I will let Father Gerard give an account of his own
proceedings with Digby for himself.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> &#8220;I spoke to
him of the uncertainty of life, and the certainty of
misery, not only in this life, but especially in the
next, unless we provided against it; and I showed
him that we have here no abiding city, but must look
for one to come. As affliction often brings sense, so
it happened in this case, for we found little difficulty
in gaining his goodwill.</p>

<p>&#8220;He prepared himself well for confession after
being taught the way; and when he learnt that I
was a priest, he felt no such difficulty in believing
as his wife had done, because he had known similar
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>cases, but he rather rejoiced at having found a confessor
who had experience among persons of his rank of life,
and with whom he could deal at all times without
danger of its being known that he was dealing with
a priest. After his reconciliation he began on his
part to be anxious about his wife, and wished to
consult with us how best to bring her to the Catholic
religion. We both smiled at this, but said nothing
at the time, determining to wait till his wife came up
to town, that we might witness how each loving soul
would strive to win the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Digby had recovered and had returned to
Gothurst with his wife, they both paid a visit to
Father Gerard at the country house, some distance
from their own home, at which he lived as chaplain.
This was probably Mrs Vaux&#8217;s house at Stoke Pogis,
of which we shall have something to say a little later.
While there, he was taken ill even more seriously
than before. His life became in danger, and the
best doctors in Oxford were sent for to his assistance.
They despaired of curing him, and &#8220;he began to
prepare himself earnestly for a good death.&#8221;His
poor young wife, being told that her husband could
not recover, began &#8220;to think of a more perfect way
of life,&#8221;in case she should be left a widow. It may
be thought that she might at least have waited to do
this until after the death of her husband, but it is
possible, and even probable, although not mentioned
by Father Gerard, that Sir Everard himself desired<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
her to consider what manner of life she would lead
when he should be gone. She would be a very young
widow with a large property, and Sir Everard would
doubtless feel anxious as to what would become of
her.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> &#8220;For some days,&#8221;says Father Gerard, &#8220;she
gave herself to learn the method of meditation, and
to find out God&#8217;s will with regard to her future life,
how she might best direct it to his glory. This was
her resolution, but God had otherwise arranged, and
for that time happily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard himself was, humanly speaking, the means
of prolonging Digby&#8217;s life, for, in spite of the verdict
of the great physicians from Oxford, that nothing
could save him, Father Gerard refused to give up
all hope, and persuaded him to send for a certain
doctor of his own acquaintance from Cambridge.
&#8220;By this doctor, then, he was cured beyond all
expectation, and so completely restored to health that
there was not a more robust or stalwart man in a
thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not very long after he had become a Catholic,
Digby was roughly reminded of the illegality of
his position, by a rumour that his friend, Father
Gerard, who had gone to a house to visit, as a
priest, a person who was dying, was either on the
point of being, or was actually, in the hands of
pursuivants. This news distressed him terribly. He
immediately told his wife that, if Father Gerard
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>were arrested, he intended to take a sufficient number
of friends and servants to rescue him, and to watch
the roads by which he would probably be taken to
London; and that &#8220;he would accomplish&#8221;his &#8220;release
one way or another, even though he should
spend his whole fortune in the venture.&#8221;The
danger of such an attempt at that period was obvious.
Certainly his desire to set free Father Gerard was
most praiseworthy, but whether, had he attempted
it in the way he proposed, he would have benefitted
or injured the Catholic cause in England, may be
considered at least doubtful. A rescue by an armed
force would have meant a free fight, probably accompanied
by some bloodshed, with this result, that, if
successful, the perpetrators would most likely have
been discovered, and sooner or later very severely
dealt with as aggressors against the officers of the
law in the execution of their duty, and that, if
unsuccessful, the greater proportion of the rescuing
party would have met their deaths either on the
field at the time, or on the gallows afterwards. To
attempt force against the whole armed power of the
Crown seemed a very Quixotic undertaking, and the
idea of dispersing the whole of his wealth, whether
in the shape of armed force or other channels, in
a chimerical effort to set free his friend, however
generous in intent, scarcely recommends itself as
the best method of using it for the good of the cause
he had so much at heart. This incident shows<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
Digby&#8217;s hastiness and impetuosity. Fortunately,
the report of Father Gerard&#8217;s arrest turned out
to be false; so, for the moment, any excited
and unwise action on Sir Everard&#8217;s part was
avoided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>A change of religion causes, to most of those who
make it, a very forcible wrench. It may be, probably
it usually is, accompanied by great happiness and a
sensation of intense relief; no regrets whatever may
be felt that the former faith, with its ministers,
ceremonies, and churches have been renounced for
ever; on the contrary, the convert may be delighted
to be rid of them, and in turning his back upon the
religion of his childhood, he may feel that he is dismissing
a false teacher who has deceived him, rather
than that he is bidding farewell to a guide who has
conducted him, however unintentionally, unwittingly,
or unwillingly, to the gate of safety. Yet granting,
and most emphatically granting, all this, we should not
forget that there is another view of his position. Let
his rejoicing be ever so great at entering that portal
and leaving the land of darkness for the regions of
light, be the welcome he receives from his future co-religionists
as warm as it may, and be his confidence as
great as is conceivable, the convert is none the less forsaking
a well-known country for one that is new to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
him, he is leaving old friends to enter among strangers,
and he is exchanging long-formed habits for practices
which it will take him some time to understand, to
acquire, and to familiarize.</p>

<p>A convert, again, is not invariably free from
dangers. Let us take the case of Sir Everard Digby.
A man with his position, popularity, wealth, intellect,
and influence, was a convert of considerable importance
from a human point of view, and he must
have known it. If he lost money and friends by
his conversion, much and many remained to him,
and among the comparatively small number of
Catholics he might become a more leading man than
as a unit in the vast crowd professing his former
faith; and although, on the whole, the step which he
had taken was calculated to be much against his
advancement in life, there are certain attractions in
being the principal or one of the principal men
of influence in a considerable minority. I am
not for a moment questioning Digby&#8217;s motives in
becoming a Catholic; I believe they were quite
unexceptionable; all that I am at the moment
aiming at is to induce the reader to keep before
his mind that the position of an influential English
convert, at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
like most other positions, had its own special temptations
and dangers, and my reasons for this aim will
soon become obvious.</p>

<p>In comparing the situation of a convert to Catholic<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>ism
in the latter days of Elizabeth or the early days
of James I., with one in the reign of Victoria, we are
met on the threshold with the fact that terrible bodily
pains, and even death itself, threatened the former,
while the latter is exposed to no danger of either for
his religion. In the matter of legal fines and forfeitures,
again, the persecution of the first was enormous,
whereas the second suffers none. But of these pains
and penalties I shall treat presently. Just in passing
I may remark that many a convert now living has
reason for doubting whether any of his forerunners in
the times of Elizabeth or James I. suffered more
pecuniary loss than he. One parent or uncle, by
altering a will, can cause a Romish recusant more
loss than a whole army of pursuivants.</p>

<p>Looking at the positions of converts at the two
periods from a social point of view, we find very
different conditions. Instead of being regarded, as he
is now, in the light of a fool who, in an age of light,
reason, and emancipation from error, has wilfully retrograded
into the grossest of all forms of superstition,
the convert, in the reigns of Elizabeth and James,
was known to be returning to the faith professed by
his fathers, one, two, or, at most, three generations before
him. It was not then considered a case of &#8220;turning
Roman Catholic,&#8221;but of returning to the old religion,
and even by people who cared little, if at all, about
such matters, he was rather respected than otherwise.</p>

<p>Now it is different. During the two last genera<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>tions,
so many conversions have apparently been the
result of what is known as the Oxford Movement, or
of Ritualism, that converts are much associated in
men&#8217;s minds with ex-clergymen, or with clerical families;
and to tell the truth, at least a considerable
minority of Anglicans of good position, while they
tolerate, invite to dinner, and patronise their parsons,
in their inmost hearts look down upon and rather
dislike the clergy and the clergy-begotten.</p>

<p>At present, again, a prejudice is felt in England
against an old Catholic, <i>prima facie</i>, on the ground
that he is probably either an Irishman, of Irish extraction,
or of an ancient Catholic English family rendered
effete by idleness, owing to religious disabilities, or by
a long succession of intermarriages. It would be easy
to prove that these prejudices, if not altogether without
foundation in fact, are immensely and unwarrantably
exaggerated, but my object, at present, is merely to
state that they exist. Three hundred years ago,
whatever may have been the prejudices against Catholics,
old or new, they cannot have arisen on such
grounds as these, and if Protestants attributed the
tenacity of the former and the determined return of
the latter to their ancient faith rather to pride
than to piety, there is no doubt which motive
would be most respected in the fashionable
world.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Digbys, immediately after
their conversion, was most exemplary. They threw<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
themselves heart and soul into their religion, and
Father Gerard, who had received them into the
Church, writes<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of Sir Everard in the highest terms,
saying:&mdash;&#8220;He was so studious a follower of virtue,
after he became a Catholic, that he gave great
comfort to those that had the guiding of his soul
(as I have heard them seriously affirm more than
once or twice), he used his prayers daily both
mental and vocal, and daily and diligent examination
of his conscience: the sacraments he frequented
devoutly every week, &amp;c.&#8221;&#8220;Briefly I have heard it
reported of this knight, by those that knew him
well and that were often in his company, that they
did note in him a special care of avoiding all occasions
of sin and of furthering acts of virtue in what
he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>He read a good deal in order to be able to enter
into controversy with Protestants, and he was the
means of bringing several into the Church&mdash;&#8220;some
of great account and place.&#8221;As to his conversation,
&#8220;not only in this highest kind, wherein he
took very great joy and comfort, but also in ordinary
talk, when he had observed that the speech did tend
to any evil, as detraction or other kind of evil
words which sometimes will happen in company,
his custom was presently to take some occasion to
alter the talk, and cunningly to bring in some other
good matter or profitable subject to talk of. And
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>this, when the matter was not very grossly evil, or
spoken to the dishonour of God or disgrace of his
servants; for then, his zeal and courage were such
that he could not bear it, but would publicly and
stoutly contradict it, whereof I could give divers
instances worth relating, but am loth to hold the
reader longer.&#8221;Finally, in speaking of those &#8220;that
knew him&#8221;and those &#8220;that loved him,&#8221;Father
Gerard says, &#8220;truly it was hard to do the one and
not the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like most Catholics living in the country, and
inhabiting houses of any size, the Digbys made a
chapel in their home, &#8220;a chapel with a sacristy,&#8221;
says Father Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> &#8220;furnishing it with costly and
beautiful vestments;&#8221;and they &#8220;obtained a Priest
of the Society&#8221;(of Jesus) &#8220;for their chaplain, who
remained with them to Sir Everard&#8217;s death.&#8221;Of
this priest, Gerard says<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> that he was a man &#8220;who
for virtue and learning hath not many his betters in
England.&#8221;This was probably Father Strange,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who
usually passed under the <i>alias</i> of Hungerford. He
was the owner of a property, some of which, in
Gloucestershire, he sold,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and &#8220;£2000 thereof is in
the Jesuites&#8217; bank&#8221;said a witness against him. He
was imprisoned, after Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s death, for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>five or six years.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In an underground dungeon in
the Tower<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> &#8220;he was so severely tortured upon the
rack that he dragged on the rest of his life for thirty-three
years in the extremest debility, with severe
pains in the loins and head. Once when he was
in agony upon the rack, a Protestant minister began
to argue with him about religion; whereupon, turning
to the rack-master, Father Strange<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> &#8220;asked him
to hoist the minister upon a similar rack, and in like
fetters and tortures, otherwise, said he, we shall be
fighting upon unequal terms; for the custom everywhere
prevails amongst scholars that the condition
of the disputants be equal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another Jesuit Father, at one time private
chaplain to Sir Everard Digby, was Father John
Percy,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who afterwards, under the <i>alias</i> of Fisher,
held the famous controversy with Archbishop Laud
in the presence of the king and the Countess
of Buckingham, to whom he acted as chaplain for
ten years. He also had been fearfully tortured in
prison, in the reign of Elizabeth; and if he recounted
his experiences on the rack to Sir Everard Digby,
the hot blood of the latter would be stirred up
against the Protestant Governments that could perpetrate
or tolerate such iniquities.</p>

<p>In trying to picture to himself the &#8220;chapel with
a sacristy&#8221;made by the Digbys at Gothurst, a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>romantic reader may imagine an ecclesiastical gem,
in the form of a richly-decorated chamber filled with
sacred pictures, figures of saints, crucifixes, candles,
and miniature shrines. Before taking the trouble of
raising any such representation before the mind, it
would be well to remember that, in the times of
which we are treating, that was the most perfect and
the best arranged chapel in which the altar, cross,
chalice, vestments, &amp;c., could be concealed at the
shortest possible notice, and the chamber itself most
quickly made to look like an ordinary room. The altar
was on such occasions a small slab of stone, a few
inches in length and breadth, and considerably less than
an inch in thickness. It was generally laid upon the
projecting shelf of a piece of furniture, which, when
closed, had the appearance of a cabinet. Some few
remains of altars and other pieces of &#8220;massing stuff,&#8221;
as Protestants called it, of that date still remain, as
also do many simple specimens used in France during
the Revolution of last century, which have much in
common with them. To demonstrate the small space
in which the ecclesiastical contents of a private chapel
could be hidden away in times of persecution, I may
say that, even now, for priests who have the privilege
of saying mass elsewhere than in churches or regular
chapels&mdash;for instance, in private rooms, on board
ship,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> or in the ward of a hospital&mdash;altar, chalice,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>paten, cruets, altar-cloths, lavabo, alb, amice, girdle,
candlesticks, crucifix, wafer-boxes, wine-flask, Missal,
Missal-stand, bell, holy-oil stocks, pyx, and a set of
red and white vestments (reversible)&mdash;in fact, everything
necessary for saying mass, as well as for
administering extreme unction to the sick, can be
carried in a case 18 inches in length, 12 inches in
width, and 8 inches in depth. Occasionally, as we
are told of the Digbys, rich people may have had
some handsome vestments; but a private chapel
early in the sixteenth century must have been a
very different thing from what we associate with
the term in our own times, and however well
furnished it may have been as a room, it must
have been almost devoid of &#8220;ecclesiastical luxury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here and there were exceptions, in which Catholics
were very bold, but they always got into trouble.
For instance, when Luisa de Carvajal came to
England, she was received at a country house&mdash;possibly
Scotney Castle, on the borders of Kent
and Sussex&mdash;the chapel of which<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> &#8220;was adorned
with pictures and images, and enriched with many
relics. Several masses were said in it every day,
and accompanied by beautiful vocal and instrumental
music.&#8221;It was &#8220;adorned not only with all the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>requisites, but all the luxuries, so to speak, of Catholic
worship;&#8221;and Luisa could walk &#8220;on a spring
morning in a pleached alley, saying her beads,
within hearing of the harmonious sounds of holy
music floating in the balmy air.&#8221;What was the
consequence? &#8220;The beautiful dream was rudely
dispelled. One night, after she had been at this
place about a month, a secret warning was given
to the master of this hospitable mansion, that he
had been denounced as a harbourer of priests, and
that the pursuivants would invade his house on
the morrow. On the receipt of this information,
measures were immediately taken to hide all traces
of Catholic worship, and a general dispersion took
place.&#8221;I only give this as a typical case to show
how necessary it then was to make chapels and
Catholic worship as secret as possible.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was anxious that others, as well
as himself, should join the body which he believed to
be the one, true, and only Church of God, and of this
I have nothing to say except in praise. An anecdote
of his efforts in this direction, however, is interesting
as showing, not only the necessities of the times, but
also something of the character and disposition of the
man. In studying a man&#8217;s life, there may be a danger
of building too much upon his actions, as if they
proved his inclinations, when they were in reality
only the result of exceptional circumstances, and I
have no wish to force the inferences, which I myself<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
draw from the following facts, upon the opinions of
other people; I merely submit them for what they
are worth.</p>

<p>Father Gerard says<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that Sir Everard &#8220;had a
friend for whom he felt a peculiar affection,&#8221;namely,
Oliver Manners, the fourth son of John, fourth Earl of
Rutland, and said by Father J. Morris<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to have been
knighted by King James I. &#8220;on his coming from
Scotland,&#8221;on April 22nd, 1603, but by Burke,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> &#8220;at
Belvoir Castle, 23rd April 1608.&#8221;He was very
anxious that this friend should be converted to the
Catholic faith, and that, to this end, he should make
the acquaintance of Father Gerard; &#8220;but because he
held an office in the Court, requiring his daily attendance
about the King&#8217;s person, so that he could not
be absent for long together,&#8221;this &#8220;desire was long
delayed.&#8221;At last Sir Everard met Manners in
London at a time when he knew that Father Gerard
was there also, &#8220;and he took an opportunity of asking
him to come at a certain time to play at cards, for
these are the books gentlemen in London study both
night and day.&#8221;Instead of inviting a card-party,
Digby invited no one except Father Gerard, and
when Manners arrived, he found Gerard and Digby
&#8220;sitting and conversing very seriously.&#8221;The latter
asked him &#8220;to sit down a little until the rest should
arrive.&#8221;After a short silence Sir Everard said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We two were engaged in a very serious conversation,
in fact, concerning religion. You know that
I am friendly to Catholics and to the Catholic faith;
I was, nevertheless, disputing with this gentleman,
who is a friend of mine, against the Catholic faith,
in order to see what defence he could make, for he
is an earnest Catholic, as I do not hesitate to tell
you.&#8221;At this he turned to Father Gerard and
begged him not to be angry with him for betraying
the fact of his being a Romish recusant to a stranger;
then he said to Manners, &#8220;And I must say he so
well defended the Catholic faith that I could not
answer him, and I am glad you have come to help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manners &#8220;was young and confident, and trusting
his own great abilities, expected to carry everything
before him, so good was his cause and so lightly did
he esteem&#8221;his opponent, &#8220;as he afterwards confessed.&#8221;
After an hour&#8217;s sharp argument and retort on either
side, Father Gerard began to explain the Catholic faith
more fully, and to confirm it with texts of Scripture,
and passages from the Fathers.</p>

<p>Manners listened in silence, and &#8220;before he left he
was fully resolved to become a Catholic, and took
with him a book to assist him in preparing for a good
confession, which he made before a week had passed.&#8221;
He became an excellent and exemplary Christian, and
his life would make an interesting and edifying
volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>All honour to Sir Everard Digby for having been
the human medium of bringing about this most happy
and blessed conversion! It might have been difficult
to accomplish it by any other method. In those days
of persecution, stratagem was absolutely necessary to
Catholics for their safety sake, even in everyday
life, and still more so in evangelism. As to the particular
stratagem used by Digby in this instance, I
do not go so far as to say that it was blame-worthy;
I have often read of it without mentally criticising
it; I have even regarded it with some degree
of admiration; but, now that I am attempting a
study of Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s character, and seeking
for symptoms of it in every detail that I can discover
of his words and actions, I ask myself whether, in all
its innocence, his conduct on this occasion did not
exhibit traces of a natural inclination to plot and
intrigue. Could he have induced Manners to come to
his rooms by no other attraction than a game of cards,
which he had no intention of playing? Was it
necessary on his arrival there to ask him to await that
of guests who were not coming, and had never been
invited? Was he obliged, in the presence of so
intimate a friend, to pretend to be only well-disposed
towards Catholics instead of owning himself to be one
of them? Need he have put himself to the trouble of
apologising to Father Gerard for revealing that he
was a Catholic? In religious, as in all other matters,
there are cases in which artifice may be harmless or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
desirable, or even a duty, but a thoroughly straightforward
man will shrink from the &#8220;pious dodge&#8221;as
much as the kind-hearted surgeon will shrink from the
use of the knife or the cautery.</p>

<p>Necessary as they may have been, nay, necessary as
they undoubtedly were, the planning, and disguising,
and hiding, and intriguing used as means for bringing
about the conversions of Lady Digby, Sir Everard
Digby, and Oliver Manners, though innocent in themselves,
placed those concerned in them in that
atmosphere of romance, adventure, excitement, and
even sentiment, which I have before described, and
it is obvious that such an atmosphere is not without
its peculiar perils.</p>

<p>It is certainly very comfortable to be able to preach
undisturbed, to convert heretics openly, and to worship
in the churches of the King and the Government; yet
even in religion, to some slight degree, the words of
a certain very wise man may occasionally be true,
that<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> &#8220;stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is
more pleasant.&#8221;Nothing is more excellent than
missionary work; but it is a fact that proselytism,
when conducted under difficulties and dangers,
whether it be under the standard of truth or under
the standard of error, is not without some of the
elements of sport; at any rate, if it be true, as
enthusiasts have been heard to assert, that even the
hunted fox is a partaker in the pleasures of the chase,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>the Jesuits had every opportunity of enjoying them
during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I.</p>

<p>Besides a consideration of the personal characteristics
of Sir Everard Digby, and the position of converts
to Catholicism in his times, it will be necessary
to take a wider view of the political, social, and
religious events of his period. Otherwise we should
be unable to form anything like a fair judgment either
of his own conduct, or of the treatment which he
received from others.</p>

<p>The oppression and persecution of Catholics by
Queen Elizabeth and her ministers was extreme. It
was made death to be a priest, death to receive absolution
from a priest, death to harbour a priest, death
even to give food or help of any sort to a
priest, and death to persuade anyone to become a
Catholic. Very many priests and many laymen were
martyred, more were tortured, yet more suffered
severe temporal losses. And, what was most cruel
of all, while Statutes were passed with a view to
making life unendurable for Catholics in England
itself, English Catholics were forbidden to go, or to
send their children, beyond the seas without special
leave.</p>

<p>The actual date of the Digbys&#8217; reception into the
Catholic Church is a matter of some doubt. It probably
took place before the death of Elizabeth. That
was a time when English Catholics were considering
their future with the greatest anxiety. Politics<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
entered largely into the question, and where politics
include, as they did then, at any rate, in many men&#8217;s
minds, some doubts as to the succession to the crown,
intrigue and conspiracy were pretty certain to be
practised.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>The responsibility of the intrigues in respect to the
claims to the English throne, at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, rests to some extent upon Queen
Elizabeth herself. As Mr Gardiner puts it:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> &#8220;She
was determined that in her lifetime no one should
be able to call himself her heir.&#8221;It was generally
understood that James would succeed to the throne;
but, so long as there was the slightest uncertainty
on the question, it was but natural that the Catholics
should be anxious that a monarch should be crowned
who would favour, or at least tolerate them, and that
they should make inquiries, and converse eagerly,
about every possible claimant to the throne. Fears
of foreign invasion and domestic plotting were
seriously entertained in England during the latter
days of Elizabeth, as well as immediately after her
death. &#8220;Wealthy men had brought in their plate
and treasure from the country, and had put them in
places of safety. Ships of war had been stationed in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>the Straits of Dover to guard against a foreign invasion,
and some of the principal recusants had, as a
matter of precaution, been committed to safe custody.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>When James VI. of Scotland, the son of the Catholic
Mary Queen of Scots, ascended the throne, rendered
vacant by the death of Elizabeth, as James I. of
England, no voice was raised in favour of any other
claimant, and<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> &#8220;the Catholics, flattered by the
reports of their agents, hailed with joy the succession
of a prince who was said to have promised the toleration
of their worship, in return for the attachment
which they had so often displayed for the house of
Stuart.&#8221;King James owed toleration, says Lingard,
&#8220;to their sufferings in the cause of his unfortunate
mother;&#8221;and &#8220;he had bound himself to it, by promises
to their envoys, and to the princes of their
communion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opinion that the new king would upset and even
reverse the anti-Catholic legislation of Elizabeth was
not confined to the Catholic body: many Protestants
had taken alarm on this very score, as may be inferred
from a contemporary tract, entitled<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <i>Advertisements
of a loyal subject to his gracious Sovereign, drawn
from the Observation of the People&#8217;s Speeches</i>, in
which the following passage occurs:&mdash;&#8220;The plebes,
I wotte not what they call them, but some there bee
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>who most unnaturally and unreverentlie, by most
egregious lies, wound the honour of our deceased
soveraigne, not onlie touching her government and
good fame, but her person with sundry untruthes,&#8221;
and after going on in this strain for some lines it
adds:&mdash;&#8220;Suerlie these slanders be the doings of the
papists, ayming thereby at the deformation of the
gospell.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, there were both Catholics and
Puritans who were distrustful of James. Sir Everard
cannot have been long a Catholic, when a dangerous
conspiracy was on foot. Sir Griffin Markham, a
Catholic, and George Brooke, a Protestant, and a
brother of Lord Cobham&#8217;s, hatched the well-known
plot which was denominated &#8220;the Bye,&#8221;and, among
many others who joined it, were two priests, Watson
and Clarke, both of whom were eventually executed
on that account. Its object appears to have been
to seize the king&#8217;s person, and wring from him
guarantees of toleration for both Puritans and
Catholics. Father Gerard acquired some knowledge
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>of this conspiracy, as also did Father Garnet, the
Provincial of the Jesuits, and Blackwell, the Archpriest;
and they insisted upon the information being
laid instantly before the Government. Before they
had time to carry out their intention, however, it
had already been communicated, and the complete
failure of the attempt is notorious. The result was
to injure the causes of both the Catholics and the
Puritans, and James never afterwards trusted the
professions of either.</p>

<p>So far as the Catholics were concerned, the &#8220;Bye&#8221;
conspiracy unfortunately revealed another; for Father
Watson, in a written confession which he made in
prison, brought accusations of disloyalty against the
Jesuits. It was quite true that, two years earlier,
Catesby, Tresham, and Winter&mdash;all friends of Sir
Everard Digby&#8217;s&mdash;had endeavoured to induce Philip
of Spain to invade England, and had asked Father
Garnet to give them his sanction in so doing; but
Garnet had &#8220;misliked it,&#8221;and had told them that
it would be as much &#8220;disliked at Rome.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Winter had arranged that if Queen Elizabeth should
die before the invasion, the news should be at once
sent to the Spanish court. For this purpose, a Yorkshire
gentleman, named Christopher Wright, and one
Guy, or Guido, Faukes, or Fawkes, &#8220;a soldier
of fortune,&#8221;of whom we shall have more to say
by-and-bye, were sent to the Court of Spain in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>1603. Although Father Garnet disapproved of the
plan, he had given Wright a letter of introduction
to a Jesuit at the Spanish Court. Neither
Wright nor Fawkes were able to rouse King Philip,
who said that he had no quarrel with his English
brother, and that he had just appointed an ambassador
to the Court of St James&#8217;s to arrange the terms of
a lasting peace with the English nation. Knowing
something of this, Father Watson used it as an
instrument of revenge against the Jesuits, who, he
knew, had intended to warn King James against
his own attempt to entrap him.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> &#8220;It is well known
to all the world,&#8221;he wrote, &#8220;how the Jesuits and
Spanish faction had continually, by word, writing,
and action, sought his majesty&#8217;s destruction, with
the setting up of another prince and sovereign over
us; yea, and although it should be revealed what
practises they had, even in this interim betwixt
the proclaiming and crowning of his majesty.&#8221;And
then he enumerated some of these &#8220;practises,&#8221;among
others, &#8220;levying 40,000 men to be in a readiness
for the Spaniard or Archduke; by buying up all
the great horses, as Gerard doth; by sending down
powder and shot into Staffordshire and other places,
with warning unto Catholics to be in a readiness;
by collection of money under divers pretences, to
the value of a million;&#8221;&#8220;by affirming that none
might yield to live under an heretic (as they con<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>tinually
termed his majesty);&#8221;&#8220;and by open speech
that the king and all his royal issue must be cut
off and put to death.&#8221;In making these bitter and,
for the most part, untrue accusations against the
Jesuits, he complained that he was &#8220;accounted for no
better than an infidel, apostate, or atheist, by the
jesuitical faction,&#8221;and that he was never likely &#8220;to
receive any favour&#8221;from his majesty &#8220;so long as
any Jesuit or Spaniard&#8221;remained &#8220;alive within this
land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, during the cruel persecutions of
Elizabeth, Jesuits, as well as secular priests, and
Catholic laymen too, for that matter, had hoped
that her successor on the English throne might be
of their own religion; they had good cause for doing
so; the Pope himself had urged the enthronement
of a Catholic monarch for their country, and in fairness,
it must be admitted that not a few Englishmen,
who considered themselves royalist above all others,
had at one time refused to regard Elizabeth herself
as the legitimate possessor of the British crown;
but, when James had been established upon the
throne, with the exception of a few discontents,
such as the conspirators in the &#8220;Bye&#8221;plot and
the diminutive Spanish party, the English Catholics,
both lay and clerical, acknowledged him as their
rightful king. Pope Clement VIII.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> &#8220;commanded
the missionaries&#8221;in England &#8220;to confine themselves
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>to their spiritual duties, and to discourage, by all
means in their power, every attempt to disturb the
tranquillity of the realm;&#8221;he also ordered &#8220;the
nuncio at Paris to assure James of the abhorrence
with which he viewed all acts of disloyalty,&#8221;and
he despatched &#8220;a secret messenger to the English
Court with an offer to withdraw from the kingdom
any missionary who might be an object of suspicion
to the Council.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the discovery of the two conspiracies
above mentioned, in which Catholics were
implicated, weighed more with James than any
assurances of goodwill from the Pope or his
emissaries. Had not Watson given King&#8217;s evidence?
Had not foreign invasion been implored by Catholics?
Had they not intended &#8220;the Lady Arabella&#8221;as a
substitute for his own Royal Majesty upon the
throne? And had they not treasonably united with
their extreme opposites, the Puritans, in a design
to capture his precious person, with a view to squeezing
concessions out of him, if not to putting him
to death? To some extent he did indeed endeavour
to conciliate the higher classes among his Catholic
subjects, by inviting them to court, by conferring
upon them the honour&mdash;such as it was&mdash;of knighthood,
as in the case of Sir Everard Digby, and by
promising to protect them from the penalties of
recusancy, so long as by their loyalty and peaceable
behaviour they should show themselves worthy of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
his favour and his confidence, but he absolutely and
abruptly refused all requests for toleration of their
religious worship, and more than once, he even
committed to the Tower Catholics who had the
presumption to ask for it.</p>

<p>The times were most trying to a recent convert
like Sir Everard Digby. I will again quote Lingard<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
to show how faithless was James to the promises
he had made of relief to his Catholic subjects:&mdash;&#8220;The
oppressive and sanguinary code framed in the reign
of Elizabeth was re-enacted to its full extent; it
was even improved with additional severities.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, after describing the severe penalties
inflicted upon those who sent children &#8220;beyond the
seas, to the intent that&#8221;they &#8220;should reside or be
educated in a Catholic college or seminary,&#8221;as well
as upon &#8220;the owners or masters of ships who&#8221;conveyed
them, and adding that &#8220;every individual who
had already resided or studied, or should hereafter
reside or study in any such college or seminary,
was rendered incapable of inheriting or purchasing
or enjoying lands, annuities, chattels, debts, or sums
of money within the realm, unless at his return to
England, he should conform to the Established
Church, he says:&mdash;&#8221;Moreover, as missionaries sometimes
eluded detection under the disguise of tutors
in gentlemen&#8217;s houses, it was provided that no man
should teach even the rudiments of grammar without
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>a license of the diocesan, under the penalty of forty
shillings per day, to be levied on the tutor himself,
and the same sum on his employer.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again, when James had been a year on the
throne, the execution of the penal laws enabled the
king &#8220;... to derive considerable profit,&#8221;says Lingard.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
&#8220;The legal fine of £20 per lunar month was again
demanded; and not only for the time to come, but
for the whole period of the suspension; a demand
which, by crowding thirteen separate payments into
one of £260, exhausted the whole annual income of
men in respectable but moderate circumstances. Nor
was this all. By law, the least default in these payments
subjected the recusant to the forfeiture of all
his goods and chattels, and of two-thirds of his lands,
tenements, hereditaments, farms, and leases. The
execution of this severe punishment was intrusted
to the judges at the assizes, the magistrates at the
sessions, and the commissioners for causes ecclesiastical
at their meetings. By them warrants of distress were
issued to constables and pursuivants; all the cattle
on the lands of the delinquent, his household furniture,
and his wearing apparel, were seized and sold; and
if, on some pretext or other, he was not thrown into
prison, he found himself and family left without a
change of apparel or a bed to lie upon, unless he
had been enabled by the charity of his friends to
redeem them after the sale, or to purchase with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>bribes the forbearance of the officers. Within six
months the payment was again demanded, and the
same pauperizing process repeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be only fair to say, however, that Mr
Gardiner thinks Lingard was guilty of exaggeration
on one point; for he says<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> &#8220;the £20 men were
never called upon for arrears, and, as far as I have
been able to trace the names, the forfeitures of goods
and chattels were only demanded from those from
whom no lands had been seized.&#8221;</p>

<p>A letter in Father Garnet&#8217;s handwriting to Father
Persons on these topics should have a special interest
for us, as it was pretty certainly written at Gothurst,
where he seems to have been staying at the time it
is dated, October 4 and 21, 1605. It says<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;The
courses taken are more severe than in Bess&#8217;s time....
If any recusant buy his goods again, they inquire
diligently if the money be his own: otherwise they
would have that too. In fine, if these courses hold,
every man must be fain to redeem, once in six
months, the very bed he lieth on: and hereof, of
twice redeeming, besides other precedents, I find one
here in Nicolas, his lodging,&#8221;<i>i.e.</i>, in the house of Sir
Everard Digby. &#8220;The judges now openly protest
that the king will have blood, and hath taken blood
in Yorkshire; and that the king hath hitherto stroked
papists, but now will strike:&mdash;and this is without
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>any desert of Catholics. The execution of two in
the north is certain:&#8221;&mdash;three persons, Welbourn
and Fulthering at York, and Brown at Ripon, had
in fact been executed in Yorkshire that year for
recusancy.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Father Garnet continues:&mdash;&#8220;and whereas
it was done upon cold blood, that is, with so great
stay after their condemnation, it argueth a deliberate
resolution of what we may expect: so that you may
see there is no hope that Paul,&#8221;<i>i.e.</i> Pope Paul V.,
&#8220;can do anything; and whatsoever men give out
there, of easy proceedings with Catholics, is mere
fabulous. And yet, notwithstanding, I am assured
that the best sort of Catholics will bear all their
losses with patience: but how these tyrannical proceedings
of such base officers may drive particular
men to desperate attempts, that I cannot answer
for;&mdash;the king&#8217;s wisdom will foresee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr Gardiner, in noticing the fines levied on recusants,
mentions<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> one point in connection with them
which would be peculiarly vexatious to a man of Sir
Everard Digby&#8217;s temperament and position. &#8220;The
Catholics must have been especially aggrieved by the
knowledge that much of the money thus raised went
into the pockets of courtiers. For instance, the profits
of the lands of two recusants were granted to a foot-man,
and this was by no means an isolated case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s great friend, Father Gerard,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>also testifies at great length to the persecutions under
Elizabeth and James.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Father Southwell was put
&#8220;nine times most cruelly upon the torture,&#8221;and the
law against the Catholics &#8220;put to cruel death many
and worthy persons,&#8221;and &#8220;many persons of great
families and estimation were at several times put to
death under pretence of treason, which also was their
cloak to cover their cruelties against such priests and
religious as were sent into England by authority from
His Holiness to teach and preach the faith of Christ,
and to minister his sacraments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, &#8220;their torturing of men when they were
taken to make them confess their acquaintance and
relievers, was more terrible than death by much, &amp;c.&#8221;
&#8220;Besides the spoiling and robbing laymen of their
livings and goods, with which they should maintain
their families, is to many more grievous than death
would be, when those that have lived in good estate
and countenance in their country shall see before
them their whole life to be led in misery, and not only
themselves, but their wives and children to go a-begging.&#8221;
&#8220;And to these the continual and cruel
searches, which I have found to be more terrible than
taking itself. The insolencies and abuses offered in
them, and in the seizures of goods, the continual awe
and fear that men are kept in by the daily expectance
of these things, while every malicious man (of which
heresy can want no plenty) is made an officer in these
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>affairs, and every officer a king as it were, to command
and insult upon Catholics at their pleasure.&#8221;It may
be readily imagined how the writer of all this would
discuss this bad state of affairs with Sir Everard at
Gothurst.</p>

<p>I have no wish to exaggerate the sufferings endured
by Catholics during the reigns of Elizabeth and the
early Stuarts. I willingly admit that in many cases the
legal penalties were not enforced against them, nay, I
would go further and frankly remind my Catholic
readers&mdash;Protestants may possibly not require to have
their memories thus stimulated&mdash;that half a century
had not elapsed since Protestants were burned at the
stake in Smithfield for their religion by Catholics.
Besides all this, it is certain that toleration, as we
understand it, is a comparatively modern invention,
and that if Mary Queen of Scots had ascended the
English throne, or if it had fallen into the hands of
Spain, Protestants in this country might not have had
a very comfortable time of it, especially in the process
of disgorging property taken from the Church, and
that, under certain circumstances, some of them might
even have suffered death for their faith; but, while
readily making this admission, I doubt whether any
Catholic government ever attempted to oblige a people
to relinquish a religion, which it had professed for many
centuries, with the persistency and cruelty which the
governments of Elizabeth and James I. exercised in
endeavouring to oblige every British subject to reject<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
the religion of his forefathers. Instances are not
wanting of Catholics dealing out stern measures
towards those who introduced a new religion into a
country; this, on the contrary, was a case of punishing
those who refused to adopt a new religion.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only ground on which the persecutions
by James appeared unfair, tyrannical, and
odious to Catholics. During the reign of Elizabeth
they had endured their sufferings as the penalties of a
religion contradicting that of their monarch. Perhaps
they did not altogether blame her so much for her
persecutions, as for persecuting the right religion in
mistake for the wrong; and, after all, they knew
she had been persuaded by her Council that, for purposes
of State, it was necessary to break off relations
with the Apostolic See, and to maintain the newly-fangled
Anglican faith; they knew that the refusal
of Rome to acknowledge her legitimacy, threatened
the very foundations of her throne, and consequently
made every Catholic seem a traitor in her eyes; they
knew, too, that the Holy See had favoured Mary
Queen of Scots, whom she had regarded as her most
dangerous rival. Under these circumstances, therefore,
while they found their troubles and trials excessively
bitter, they may not have been very profoundly
astonished at them. But when James, after
a brief respite, continued and even increased the
persecutions of the previous reign, they looked at the
matter in quite a different light. In the first place,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
they expected that the Protestant son of so Catholic
a mother, who had suffered imprisonment and death
because she was a Catholic, could scarcely become the
friend and accomplice of those who had betrayed and
martyred his mother. I am not trenching on the
question of the martyrdom of Mary Queen of Scots;
I am merely writing of the feeling respecting her death,
prevalent at that time among members of her own
religion in this country. Secondly, unlike Elizabeth,
James had no cause for fearing the Holy See; it
never questioned his legitimacy; it had assisted him
when King of Scotland; its adherents in England had
almost universally hailed his accession to the crown
with loyalty and rejoicing; and, as I have already
shown, the Pope had sent messages to him, offering to
assist in assuring the allegiance of the Catholics by removing
any priests who might be obnoxious to him.</p>

<p>Even Goodman, the Protestant Bishop of Gloucester,
wrote<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;After Sixtus Quintus succeeded Clement
Octavus, a man, according to his name, who was much
given to mercy and compassion. Now to him King
James did make suit to favour his title to the crown
of England, which as King James doth relate in his
book, <i>Triplici nodo triplex cuneus</i>, the Pope did
promise to do.&#8221;James said that he would show
favour to Catholics<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> &#8220;were it not that the English
would take it ill, and it would much hinder him in
his succession; and withall, that his own subjects
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>in Scotland were so violent against Catholics, that he,
being poor, durst not offend them. Whereupon the
Pope replied, that if it were for want of means, he
would exhaust all the treasures of the church and
sell the plate to supply him.&#8221;And again, says Goodman
of the English Catholics and King James<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;And
certainly they had very great promises from
him.&#8221;Nevertheless,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> &#8220;he did resolve to run a course
against the papists,&#8221;and &#8220;at his discourses at table
usually he did express much hatred to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Gerard writes that<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> there were &#8220;particular
embassagies and letters from His Majesty unto other
Princes, giving hope at least of toleration to Catholics
in England, of which letters divers were translated
this year into French and came so into England,
as divers affirmed that had seen them.&#8221;He was
also &#8220;well assured that immediately upon Queen
Elizabeth&#8217;s sickness and death, divers Catholics of
note and fame, Priests also, did ride post into Scotland,
as well to carry the assurance of dutiful affection
from all Catholics unto His Majesty as also to
obtain his gracious favour for them and his royal
word for confirmation of the same. At that time,
and to those persons, it is certain he did promise
that Catholics should not only be quiet from any
molestations, but should also enjoy such liberty in
their houses privately as themselves would desire,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>and have both Priests and Sacraments with full
toleration and desired quiet. Both the Priests that
did kneel before him when he gave this promise
(binding it with the word of a Prince, which he
said was never yet broken), did protest so much
unto divers from whom I have it. And divers
others, persons of great worth, have assured me
the same upon the like promise received from His
Majesty, both for the common state of Catholics and
their own particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is dangerous to make too much of evidence
against which there may be the shadow of a suspicion.
Father Gerard&#8217;s personal testimony can be accepted
without the smallest hesitation; but that of Father
Watson, who was probably one of the priests he
mentioned who &#8220;did kneel before&#8221;James when
he made the solemn promise which Father Gerard
heard of at second hand, should be received with
more caution. Lord Northampton&#8217;s statement in
his speech at Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s trial should
certainly obtain very careful consideration. &#8220;No
man,&#8221;said he,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> &#8220;can speak more soundly to the
point than myself; for being sent into the prison
by the King to charge him with this false alarm&#8221;
(<i>i.e.</i>, the report that James had promised toleration
to Catholics), &#8220;only two days before his death, and
upon his soul to press him in the presence of God,
and as he would answer it at another bar, to confess
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>directly whether at either or both these times he
had access unto his Majesty at Edinburgh, his
Majesty did give him any promise, hope, or comfort
of encouragement to Catholics concerning toleration;
he did there protest upon his soul that he could
never win one inch of ground or draw the smallest
comfort from the King in those degrees, nor further
than that he would have them apprehend, that as
he was a stranger to this state, so, till he understood
in all points how those matters stood, he would not
promise favour any way; but did protest that all
the crowns and kingdoms in this world should not
induce him to change any jot of his profession, which
was the pasture of his soul and earnest of his eternal
inheritance. He did confess that in very deed, to
keep up the hearts of Catholics in love and duty to
the King, he had imparted the King&#8217;s words to
many, in a better tune and a higher kind of descant
than his book of plainsong did direct, because he
knew that others, like sly bargemen, looked that
way when their stroke was bent another way. For
this he craved pardon of the King in humble manner,
and for his main treasons, of a higher nature than
these figures of hypocrisy, and seemed penitent,
as well for the horror of his crime as for the falsehood
of his whisperings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably Northampton may have exaggerated,
possibly he may have lied, in making this statement;
but there is this to be remembered, that owing to his<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
false testimony against the Jesuits, already recorded
in this chapter, Father Watson must be regarded as a
somewhat discredited witness, and it will not do for us
Catholics to accept his verbal evidence against King
James, and then to turn round and repudiate the
evidence against the Jesuits in his own handwriting,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
without some very strong reason for so doing. A
reason of a certain strength does indeed exist; for
Watson&#8217;s evidence against James was given freely and
uninterestedly; whereas his evidence against the
Jesuits may very probably have been offered in the
hope that it might be accepted as the price of pardon,
or at least of some mitigation of the awful sufferings
included in the form of death to which he had
been sentenced.</p>

<p>Even if we altogether discard Watson&#8217;s evidence of
James&#8217;s promises, enough remains to satisfy my own
mind that the new king had given the Catholics more
or less hope of toleration; and, if I am too easily
satisfied on this point, there can be no sort of question
that Sir Everard Digby, who was often with
Father Gerard, and that many other English Catholics
had been assured, rightly or wrongly, and believed,
wrongly or rightly, that King James had solemnly
promised to give them immunity from persecution,
if not freedom of worship, and that he had basely
and treacherously broken his faith with them and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>sold them for the price of popularity among his far
more numerous Protestant subjects: who, then, can
blame them for considering themselves to have been
most unjustly, perfidiously, and infamously treated by
that monarch?</p>

<p>It may be worth while to quote here again from
Goodman, the Protestant Bishop of Gloucester,
respecting the persecutions of the Catholics in the
reign of James.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> &#8220;Now that they saw the times
settled, having no hope of better days, but expecting
that the uttermost rigour of the law should be
executed, they became desperate; finding that by the
laws of the kingdom their own lives were not secured,
and for the coming over of a priest into England
it was no less than high treason. A gentlewoman
was hanged only for relieving and harbouring a
priest; a citizen was hanged only for being reconciled
to the Church of Rome: besides, the penal laws were
such and so executed that they should not subsist:&mdash;what
was usually sold in shops and openly bought,
this the pursuivant would take away from them as
being popish and superstitious. One knight did
affirm that in one term he gave twenty nobles in
rewards to the doorkeeper of the attorney-general;
another did affirm, that his third part which remained
to him of his estate did hardly serve for his expense
in law to defend him from other oppressions, besides
their children to be taken from home to be brought up
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>in another religion. So they did every way conclude
that their estate was desperate, etc.&#8221;If objection
should be taken to Goodman as a witness on the
Protestant side, on the ground that he eventually
became a Catholic, I would reply that, at the time he
wrote what I have quoted, he was, as the editor of his
<i>Court of James the First</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> &#8220;an earnest and
zealous supporter of the Church,&#8221;of England, and
of James I., Goodman himself writes<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in that very
book:&mdash;&#8220;Truly I did never know any man of so
great an apprehension, of so great love and affection&mdash;a
man so truly just, so free from all cruelty and pride,
such a lover of the church, and one that had done so
much good for the church.&#8221;Such an admirer of King
James might certainly be trusted not to say a word
that he could honestly avoid about the ill-treatment
endured by any class of his subjects during his reign.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Considering that the king had been led to distrust
the Catholics through the two lately discovered plots
in which some of their number had taken part, the
best policy for those who remained loyal, and these
were by far the majority, would have been to have
taken every opportunity of displaying their faithfulness
to their sovereign, and, for those whose position
so entitled them, to present themselves as often as
they conveniently could at his Court, even if their
welcome was somewhat cold. Digby chose to follow
an exactly opposite course. He went to Court on
James&#8217;s accession and received knighthood, and then
he returned to the country, only visiting London
occasionally, and then not going to Court. Like his
fellow-Catholics, he at first entertained hopes that the
new king was about to exhibit toleration, and as
much as any of them was he disappointed and embittered
as time speedily began to prove the contrary.
One cause of Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s disgust at the aspect
of affairs, early in James the First&#8217;s reign, may have
been that, as a courtier, he had expected much from<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
the Queen&#8217;s being a Catholic,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and that not only
did no apparent good come of it, but her example
gave the greatest discouragement, as well as grave
scandal, to such of her subjects as professed her
own religion. Indeed, all that can safely be said
of her Catholicism, is that she was<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> &#8220;a Catholic,
so far, at least, as her pleasure-loving nature allowed
her to be of any religion at all.&#8221;Nevertheless, &#8220;she
took great delight in consecrated,&#8221;&mdash;or, as Catholics
would say, blessed or sacred&mdash;&#8220;objects.&#8221;She had
allowed herself to be crowned by<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> &#8220;a Protestant
Archbishop; but when the time arrived for the
reception of the Communion, she remained immovable
on her seat, leaving the King to partake alone.&#8221;
&#8220;Enthusiastic Catholics complained that she had no
heart for anything but festivities and amusements,
and during the rest of her life she attended the
services of the church sufficiently to enable the
Government to allege that she was merely an enemy
of Puritanical strictness.&#8221;On one occasion, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>king,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> &#8220;with some difficulty,&#8221;had actually &#8220;induced
her to receive the Communion with him at Salisbury,
but she had been much vexed with herself since, and
had refused to do it again. On Christmas Day she
had accompanied him to Church, but since then he
found it impossible to induce her to be present at
a Protestant service. At one time Sir Anthony
Standen, a Catholic, was employed by James on a
mission to some of the Italian States, and he brought
home with him some objects of devotion, as a present
from the Pope to the Queen of England. These
delighted her; yet, when the king heard of them,
they were returned to the Pope through the Nuncio
in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now to any good Catholic, especially to an exceedingly
zealous convert in his first fervour, like Sir
Everard Digby, a Protestant king might be tolerable,
provided he treated his Catholic subjects properly;
but a court presided over by a queen, herself a convert,
who was a most indifferent Catholic, if not an
apostate,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> would be odious in the extreme. It was
difficult enough, in any case, to make many simple
Catholics understand that there was anything very
wrong in avoiding persecution by putting in an
occasional appearance at the Protestant churches,
without joining in the service, if they heard mass
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>when they could, and went regularly to confession
and communion; but the difficulty was
immensely increased when they heard that the
greatest lady in the land, who was herself a Catholic,
did that very thing. Again, the country-gentlemen
of high estate, Sir Everard Digby among them,
suffered fines and penalties for their faith; yet here
was the Catholic queen herself, contently living in
the greatest luxury, and yielding on the most important
points of her religion, in order to obtain
it.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> No wonder, therefore, that Sir Everard Digby
absented himself from Court, however impolitic it
may have been in him to do so.</p>

<p>In his country home, at Gothurst, he brooded,
with much impatience, over the wrongs of his co-religionists,
nor can it have been a pleasant reflection
that at any moment his beautiful house might be
broken into by pursuivants, who would hunt every
recess and cupboard in it, in search of a priest, or of
what Anglicans then denominated &#8220;massing-stuff.&#8221;
Should they suspect that the most richly carved
pieces of oak-work concealed a hiding-place, the
&#8220;officers of justice&#8221;would ruthlessly shatter them to
pieces with axe or crowbar; his wife&#8217;s private rooms
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>would not be safe from the intrusion of the pursuivants,
or the bevy of rough followers who might
accompany them; and, if his house were filled with
guests, even were they Protestants, it would none the
less necessarily be given up to the intruders for so long
a time as they might choose to remain. The invasion
would be as likely to be made by night as by day;
no notice would be given of its approach, and, as its
result, not only might the domestic chaplain be carried
off a prisoner, with his face to a horse&#8217;s tail and his
legs tied together beneath its girths, but Sir Everard
himself would be liable to be taken away in the same
humiliating position, on a charge of High Treason.</p>

<p>The fine which Catholics had to pay must have
been sufficiently annoying even to a rich man like Sir
Everard Digby, and this annoyance would be greatly
increased by the knowledge that to poorer men it
meant ruin, as well as by the remarks of his less
wealthy Catholic friends that &#8220;after all, to him it was
a mere nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The present was bad enough, and worse things were
expected in the future. Most of us know the fears
with which we hear that a Prime Minister of opposite
politics to our own is going to bring in a bill, in the
coming session, directed against our personal interests;
even the coming budget of a Chancellor of the
Exchequer on our own side of the House, in a very
bad year, is anticipated with serious misgivings.
Imagine, therefore, the terrors of the Catholics whose<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
lives would already have been rendered unendurable,
had the laws existing against them been put into full
force, when they not only observed a rapidly increasing
zeal among magistrates and judges in their proceedings
against Romish recusants, but heard, on what
appeared to be excellent authority, that additional,
and most cruel, legislation against them
was to be enacted in the Parliament shortly to be
opened.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features in Sir Everard
Digby&#8217;s character was his extreme susceptibility to the
influence of others; and, for this reason, what may
seem, at first sight, an undue proportion of a volume
devoted to his biography, must necessarily be allotted
to a description of the friends, and more especially one
particular friend, under whose influence he fell; and,
if my readers should sometimes imagine that I have
forgotten Sir Everard Digby altogether, or if they
should feel inclined to accuse me of writing Catesby&#8217;s
life rather than Digby&#8217;s, I can assure them that I am
guiltless on both counts. For the moment, however,
I must beg them to prepare themselves for an immediate
and long digression, or rather an apparent digression,
and warn them that it will be followed by many
others.</p>

<p>To an impetuous man, zealous to the last degree,
but not according to knowledge, few things are
more dangerous than an intimate friend of similar
views and temperament. Exactly such a friend<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
had Sir Everard Digby. Here is a description of
him by one who knew him well.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He &#8220;grew to
such a composition of manners and carriage, to such
a care of his speech (that it might never be hurtful
to others, but taking all occasions of doing good),
to such a zealous course of life, both for the cause
in general, and for every particular person whom
he could help in God&#8217;s service, as that he grew to
be very much respected by most of the better and
graver sort of Catholics, and of Priests, and Religious
also, whom he did much satisfy in the care of his
conscience; so that it might plainly appear he had
the fear of God joined with an earnest desire to
serve Him. And so no marvel though many Priests
did know him and were often in his company. He
was, moreover, very wise and of great judgment,
though his utterance was not so good. Besides, he
was so liberal and apt to help all sorts, as it got
him much love. He was of person above two yards
high, and, though slender, yet as well proportioned
to his height as any man one should see. His age
(I take it) at his death was about thirty-five, or
thereabouts. And to do him right, if he had not
fallen into&#8221;&mdash;one particular and exceedingly &#8220;foul
action and followed his own judgment in it (to the
hurt and scandal of many), asking no advice but
of his own reasons deceived and blinded under the
shadow of zeal; if, I say, it had not been for this,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>he had truly been a man worthy to be highly
esteemed and prized in any commonwealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Be his attractions and virtues what they might,
this man, Robert Catesby, had not anything like
such an unblemished past as his friend, Sir Everard
Digby. He was of an old Warwickshire and
Northamptonshire family&mdash;he was the lineal descendant
of William Catesby, who was attainted
and executed for high treason after the battle of
Bosworth Field.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Robert Catesby&#8217;s father, who had
been an ardent Catholic, had suffered considerable
losses in his estate, and been imprisoned on account
of his religion; but Robert himself, on his father&#8217;s
death, apostatized, became exceedingly dissolute, and
still further impoverished the family property by
his extravagance. Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester,
says of him:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> &#8220;For Catesby, it is very well
known that he was a very cunning, subtle man,
exceedingly entangled in debts, and scarce able to
subsist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some three or four years before Sir Everard
Digby&#8217;s conversion, Catesby had returned to the
faith of his fathers. Whatever may have been the
love of his God manifested by the reformed reprobate,
his hatred of his queen, and afterwards of
his king, was unmeasured. I have no desire to say
anything in disparagement of Catesby&#8217;s religious
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>fervour; but, considering that he had once abjured
the Catholic faith, it may be no harm to remark
that some people seem to like to profess the religion
hated most by their enemies, and to exhibit zeal
for it in proportion to that shown by their enemies
against it. With several of his friends, Catesby
joined the ill-fated conspiracy of the Earl of Essex,
in the course of which he was wounded, taken
prisoner, and finally ransomed for £3000 in all.
When fighting for Essex, he greatly distinguished
himself as a swordsman. Later, as I have already
said, he was implicated in the intrigue that sent
Christopher Wright and Guy Fawkes to Madrid in
the hope of inducing Philip of Spain to depose
James I. A modern Jesuit, Father J. Hungerford
Pollen, has well said of him:<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> &#8220;The owner of large
estates in the counties of Northampton, Warwick, and
Oxford, honourably married, with issue to perpetuate
the ancient family of which he was the only representative&mdash;such
is not the sort of man we should
have thought likely to engage in a desperate adventure,
and this presumption might be further
strengthened by the consideration of his moral
qualities. He was brave and accomplished, attractive
to that degree which makes even sober men risk
life and fortune to follow where he should lead,
honest of purpose and truthful, and, above all,
exceedingly zealous for religion. These qualities
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>should have, and would have, insured him from
the frightful error into which he fell, had they not
run to excess in more than one direction. Full of
the chivalry that characterised the Elizabethan period,
he was also infected with its worldliness, a failing
which ill accorded with the patience every Catholic
had to practice, and, moreover, his force of character
carried him into obstinate adherence to his own views
and plans. This it was that worked such ruin upon
himself and all those who came in contact with him.
Happy times may lead such men so to direct their
energies, that the evil side of their character is never
displayed, but times of great temptation often bring
out the latent flaw in unexpected ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is admirably put, except, perhaps, on one
single point; and it is one of such importance that
I will pause to consider it, especially as it applies to
Sir Everard Digby, almost, if not quite, as much as
to Catesby. In the reign of Elizabeth, it was not
chivalry but the decay and abolition of chivalry
and the chivalrous spirit which occasionally led to
deeds which a knight-errant would have despised.
As Sir Walter Scott says:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> &#8220;the habit of constant
and honourable opposition, unembittered by rancour
or personal hatred, gave the fairest opportunity for
the exercise of the virtues required from him whom
Chaucer terms a very perfect gentleman.&#8221;Again
he says:&mdash;&#8220;We have seen that the abstract principles
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>of chivalry were, in the highest degree, virtuous and
noble, nay, that they failed by carrying to an absurd,
exaggerated, and impracticable point, the honourable
duties which they inculcated.&#8221;Chivalry, therefore,
acted as a wholesome check upon the barbarity, the
licentiousness, and the semi-civilisation of the middle
ages, and when it was abolished, the knights and
nobles, in spite of all the glamour of refinement and
education in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI.,
Mary, and Elizabeth, still retained enough of the
savage brutality of their forefathers to be occasionally
very dangerous, when the discipline of chivalry had
been withdrawn. &#8220;It is needless,&#8221;says Sir Walter
Scott, &#8220;by multiplying examples, to illustrate the
bloodthirsty and treacherous maxims and practices,
which, during the sixteenth century, succeeded to
the punctilious generosity exacted by the rules of
chivalry. It is enough to call to the reader&#8217;s recollection
the bloody secret of the massacre of St
Bartholomew, which was kept by such a number of
the Catholic noblemen for two years,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> at the expense
of false treaties, promises, and perjuries, and the
execution which followed on naked, unarmed, and
unsuspecting men, in which so many gallants lent
their willing swords.&#8221;Now I am not going to enter
here upon the question of Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s historical
accuracy, or its contrary, on this horrible massacre;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>but might he not have extended his period &#8220;of
treacherous maxims and practices,&#8221;which &#8220;succeeded
to the punctilious generosity exacted by the rules of
chivalry,&#8221;a few years later, and included, with the
Massacre of St Bartholomew, the Gunpowder Plot?
Catesby was quite a man of the type contemplated by
Sir Walter Scott, gallant, charming, zealous, brave
to a degree, and even pious, yet with something of
the wild, lawless, and bloodthirsty spirit of the but
partially-tamed savage, which every now and then
asserted itself, until an even later period, unless it
was kept under control by some such laws as those
of chivalry. It was not, therefore, chivalry, but the
<i>want</i> of chivalry, which led to the spirit, habits,
and actions of Catesby and the other conspirators in
the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p>I hope this digression&mdash;a digression from a digression&mdash;may
be pardoned. It is high time that I
returned to Robert Catesby in his relations to Sir
Everard Digby.</p>

<p>It was likely enough that Sir Everard Digby should
become intimate with a zealous Catholic landowner
in the neighbouring counties of Northamptonshire,
and Warwickshire, especially as Catesby&#8217;s mother&#8217;s
house, at Ashby St Legers, was little more than
twenty miles from Gothurst; but probably the
reason of his seeing so much of him was that Catesby&#8217;s
first cousin, Tyringham of Tyringham, lived only
three-quarters of a mile from Gothurst, the two<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>
estates adjoining each other, either house lying within
a short distance of the high road, on opposite sides
of it.</p>

<p>Once on intimate terms, Sir Everard and Catesby
were constantly together. In speaking of his master,
Sir Everard&#8217;s page, William Ellis, said in his examination<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;both
at London and in the countrie Mr
Robert Catesby hath kept him companie.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this not altogether desirable &#8220;companie,&#8221;Sir
Everard Digby spent much time &#8220;in cogitation deep&#8221;
upon the treatment of his fellow-religionists and
countrymen. Both men were exasperated by the
persecution which was going on around them, by the
fickleness of their king, and by the dangers to which
they, their wives, their families&mdash;for Sir Everard, as
well as Catesby, had a child now&mdash;and their estates
were exposed. Perhaps most irritating of all, to
country-gentlemen of high position, was the then
prevalent custom of sub-letting, or farming, the fines
and penalties levyable upon Catholics to men who
squeezed every farthing out of them that was possible.
To be persecuted and fined by an authorized public
official was bad enough; but to be pestered and
tormented by a pettifogging private person who had
purchased the right of doing so, as a speculation, must
have been almost unendurable. The subject, however,
which Digby and Catesby discussed most would
probably be the severe anti-Catholic legislation which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>was apprehended from the new parliament. In this,
said Catesby, the great danger lay. His surmises
as to the form it might take would give him and his
friend, Sir Everard, ample scope for contemplation,
speculation, and conversation. The words of Scripture,
&#8220;Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof,&#8221;do not
appear to have occurred to their memories.</p>

<p>In periods of trouble and danger, as indeed in all
others, men of different dispositions and temperaments
take different views and different lines of
conduct; there are optimists and pessimists, men
who counsel endurance, men who advocate active
resistance, men who advise waiting a little to see
what may turn up, and men who urge that not a
moment is to be lost. And so it was among the persecuted
Catholics during the early years of the reign
of James I. At the very time that men like Digby
and Catesby were in the deepest depression of hopeless
anxiety, the Spanish Ambassador was congratulating
himself because he fancied he saw symptoms
of the king&#8217;s inclination to become<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> a convert to the
Catholic Church. On the other hand, among those
who took the most gloomy view of the prospect, there
were very distinct phases of thought and action.
&#8220;England will witness with us,&#8221;says Father Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
&#8220;that the greatest part by much did follow the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>example and exhortation of the Religious and Priests
that were their guides, moving them and leading
them by their own practice to make their refuge unto
God in so great extremities.... This we found to
be believed practically by most, and followed as faithfully,
preparing themselves by more often frequentation
of the Sacraments, by more fervent prayer, and
by perfect resignation of their will to God, against
the cloud that was like to cover them, and the
shower that might be expected would pour down
upon them after the Parliament, unto which all the
chief Puritans of the land were called, and only they
or their friends selected out of every shire to be the
framers of the laws, which thereby we might easily
know were chiefly intended and prepared against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he says all were not quite so perfect, and of
these imperfect there were two leading divisions. The
first<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> &#8220;fainted in courage, and, as St Cyprian noteth
of his times, did offer themselves unto the persecutors
before they felt the chief force of the blow that was
to be expected.&#8221;Sir Everard Digby was not one of
these. The second division were, as Father Gerard
might most veraciously say, &#8220;much different from
these, and ran headlong into a contrary error. For
being resolved never to yield or forsake their faith,
they had not patience and longanimity to expect the
Providence of God, etc.&#8221;It is to be feared that he
may have noticed this want of patience and longa<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>nimity
in Sir Everard Digby and his companions.
&#8220;They would not endure to see their brethren so
trodden upon by every Puritan,&#8221;he goes on to say of
this class, &#8220;so made a prey to every needy follower
of the Court, or servant to a Councillor, so presented
and pursued by every churchwarden and minister,
so hauled to every sessions when the Justices list to
meet, so wronged on every side by the process of
excommunication or outlawry, and forced to seek
for their own by law, and then also to be denied by
law, because they were Papists; finally both themselves
and all others to be denounced traitors and
designed to the slaughter. These things they would
not endure now to begin afresh after so long endurance,
and therefore began amongst themselves to
consult what remedy they might apply to all these
evils,&#8221;&amp;c., &#8220;so that it seems they did not so much
respect what the remedy were, or how it might be
procured, as that it might be sure and speedy&mdash;to wit,
to take effect before the end of the Parliament from
whence they seemed to expect their greatest harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who followed the latter course may have
included some who were in other respects good
Christians; whether they showed the spirit of
Martyrs and Confessors is another question.</p>

<p>Few things discouraged the English Catholics
more than the goodwill and peaceful disposition
shown to the new king by foreign Catholic kings
and princes, notwithstanding that one final effort<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
was made on their behalf by Spain, just as the
treaty was being concluded with England for peace
and the renewal of commercial intercourse. Velasco,
the constable of Castile, who negotiated that treaty
on behalf of Spain, was visited by Winter, at
Catesby&#8217;s suggestion, and urged to assist the English
Catholics. Although he promised to speak on their
behalf, he made it clear that his country would
make no sacrifice to obtain toleration for them.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> So
far as he had promised, he kept his word. He told
James that whatever indulgence he might show to
them would be regarded by Philip as a personal act
of friendship towards himself, and that they were
prepared to make a voluntary offering annually in
the place of the fines at that time imposed upon
them by law; and he laid before him statistics of
the distress to which very many respectable English
families had been reduced by clinging to the faith
of their forefathers.</p>

<p>James&#8217;s reply was very decided. On any diplomatic
question relating to the interests of England
and Spain he would be ready and glad to confer
with the Spanish representative, but the government
of his own subjects was a domestic matter
upon which he could not consent to enter with a
foreigner. Besides this, he informed Velasco that,
even were he himself inclined to better the condition
of the Catholics, his doing so would offend his</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span></p>
<p>Protestant subjects to such an extent as to endanger
his throne.</p>

<p>It would almost seem as if Velasco&#8217;s endeavours
on behalf of the Catholics had a contrary effect to
that which had been intended; for, instead of
granting them the smallest relief, James issued a
proclamation, ordering the judges and magistrates to
enforce the penal laws, and to adopt measures calculated
to insure the detection of Catholic recusants.
Before the judges started on their circuits, he called
them together and charged them &#8220;to be diligent
and severe against recusants.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Accordingly, in the
year 1604, about 1000 recusants were indicted in
Yorkshire, 600 in Lancashire, and in the counties
of Oxford, Berks, Gloucester, Monmouth, Hereford,
Salop, Stafford, and in Wigorn, 1865.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Of
Buckinghamshire, Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s county, I can
find no return. In all, the number of Catholic
recusants convicted in the years 1604-5 amounted
to 5500. In July, a priest named Sugar was
executed at Warwick, simply and only because he
was a priest, and a layman, named Grissold, for
&#8220;accompanying and assisting&#8221;him.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In the Star
Chamber, a man named Pound accused Sergeant
Phillips of injustice in condemning a neighbour of
his to death, for no other crime except that he had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>entertained a Jesuit. Not only did the lords of the
Star Chamber confirm and approve of this sentence
of Sergeant Phillips, but they condemned Pound
himself to lose one ear in London and one &#8220;in the
country where he dwelleth,&#8221;and to be fined £1000,
unless he would impeach those who advised him to
make the suit. Fortunately this tremendous sentence
was commuted, at the intercession of the French and
Venetian Ambassadors, to standing for a whole day
in the pillory.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft had just ascended the archiepiscopal throne
of Canterbury, full of zeal against the Papists. He
urged his suffragan bishops to select the more wealthy
and earnest among the Catholics, and, after first
trying &#8220;sweet&#8221;and &#8220;kind means,&#8221;to excommunicate
them if they should refuse to conform. Forty
days after their excommunication, the Bishops were
to certify their names in Chancery, and then to sue
out a writ <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>, an instrument
which subjected the delinquents to outlawry,
forfeiture, and imprisonment, and deprived them of
the right of recovering debts, of suing for damages,
of effecting legal sales or purchases, and of conveying
their properties either by will or otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, writes<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;The
Spiritual Court did not cease to molest them, to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>excommunicate them, then to imprison them; and
thereby they were utterly unable to sue for their
own.&#8221;Nor were the rumours of an approaching
increase of severities, to be enacted in the ensuing
parliament, mere exaggerated fancies. The denunciations
of the Chancellor in the Star Chamber, and of
Archbishop Bancroft at St Paul&#8217;s Cross, confirmed the
reports that sterner legislation against recusants was
impending in the coming session. On the other
hand, it is just possible that these official threats
may have been uttered only to terrify the Catholics
into submission, and with no very serious expectation
of their fulfilment.</p>

<p>During those distressing times, Catesby&#8217;s friends,
among whom not the least was Sir Everard Digby,
observed a change in his manner. He looked anxious
and careworn; he was moody and abstracted at one
moment, unusually loquacious and excitable at another.
His mysterious absences from home were
another source of uneasiness to those most intimate
with him; so, too, were his large purchases of
horses, arms, and gunpowder, which also attracted
the attention of people who were not his friends;
but he took great trouble to inform everybody that
he was about to raise 300 horse, to join the English
regiment which the Spanish Ambassador had prevailed
upon King James to allow to be levied in England
for the assistance of the Archduke in Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, his friends were not satisfied. If he
were really going to join the army in the Low
Countries, why these long delays?</p>

<p>Great as was their intimacy, Catesby was in the
condition just described for many months without
confiding the real reason of his activity to Sir
Everard Digby; although it is probable that he
warned him to be prepared for any emergency which
might arise for the use of men, arms, and horses.
Both Digby and Catesby were heartily tired of a
state of passive endurance; the tyranny which was
crushing the Catholics was daily increasing, and Sir
Everard might very naturally suppose that while
Catesby had no definite plan for resisting it, he
wished to be ready in case foreign powers might
come to their assistance, or the whole body of
English Catholics, goaded to desperation, might rise
in rebellion against their oppressors. Freely as he
might appear to talk to Digby, and satisfied as the
latter may have felt that he had the confidence of
his friend, Catesby in reality feared to intrust a
great secret, which was absorbing his attention, to
the brave but straightforward master of Gothurst.</p>

<p>Another of Catesby&#8217;s friends was less easy about
him than Sir Everard Digby. Father Garnet, the
Provincial of the Jesuits, suspected that some mischief
was brewing, and seized an opportunity, when
sitting at Catesby&#8217;s own table, of inculcating the
duty of patient submission to persecution. His host,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
who was his personal friend as well as a great
respecter of his wisdom as a priest, showed considerable
irritation. Instead of treating the Provincial of
the Jesuits with his usual reverence and courtesy, he
flushed up and angrily exclaimed<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;It is to you,
and such as you, that we owe our present calamities.
This doctrine of non-resistance makes us slaves. No
authority of priest or pontiff can deprive man of his
right to repel injustice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another friend and frequent guest of young Sir
Everard&#8217;s, after he became a Catholic, should be
noticed. A younger son of a Worcestershire family,
Thomas Winter had attractions for Digby, in his
profound zeal for the Catholic Church, his scholarship,
his knowledge of foreign languages, his powers of
conversation, and his military experiences, as he had
served in Flanders, France, and, says Father Gerard,
&#8220;I think, against the Turk.&#8221;Unlike Catesby, he
was &#8220;of mean stature, but strong and comely,&#8221;
and of &#8220;fine carriage.&#8221;He was very popular in
society, and &#8220;an inseparable friend to Mr Robert
Catesby.&#8221;In age he was about ten years older than
Sir Everard. Whatever his zeal may have been for
the Catholic Church, he did not always live in the
odour of sanctity, and on one occasion he incurred
the grave displeasure of Father Garnet by conveying
a challenge to a duel from John Wright, one of the
earliest conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot, to an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>adversary who had offended him. The combatants
met, and Winter, as Wright&#8217;s second, measured the
swords of both duellists to ascertain whether they
were of equal length; but the actual encounter was
somehow prevented at the last moment.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Father
Garnet says that he had a &#8220;hard conceit of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In dealing with the subject of Digby&#8217;s friends,
certainly his page, William Ellis, ought not to be
forgotten. I have been unable to discover any
details of his birth, except that he was heir to £80
a year&mdash;a much larger income, of course, in those
days than in these&mdash;&#8220;if his father did him right.&#8221;
He entered Sir Everard&#8217;s service at the age of seventeen,
about May 1604.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> How faithful he was to his
master will appear by-and-bye.</p>

<p>Among Sir Everard&#8217;s younger friends was Lord
Vaux of Harrowden, a cousin of Catesby&#8217;s. One
reason of the intimacy is thus described by Father
Gerard.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> &#8220;Sir Everard had many serious occasions
to come to my Lord Vaux&#8217;s; and then in particular,
as I have learned since, being come from his [Digby&#8217;s]
ancient house and chief living, which lay in Rutlandshire,
from whence he could not go unto the house
where his wife and family lay [Gothurst], but he
must pass the door of Lord Vaux, his house, which
also made him there an ordinary guest.&#8221;To harbour
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>priests, and to defend the Catholic cause was no new
thing in the family of Vaux, for, some twenty or
thirty years earlier, Lord Vaux&#8217;s grandfather had
been imprisoned and fined for sheltering Father
Campian in his house.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> His grandmother had been
a daughter of John Tresham of Rushton, and of
his cousin, Francis Tresham, we shall hear something
presently. His mother and his aunts, Anne
and Elizabeth, were most pious Catholics, but the
religious atmosphere in which he was brought up
does not seem to have led him to perfection; for,
although as a young man he suffered imprisonment
for his faith,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> he afterwards had two sons, who bore
the name of Vaux, by Lady Banbury during her
husband&#8217;s lifetime;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and, although he married her
after Lord Banbury&#8217;s death, she never had another
child. Worse still, he left Harrowden and the other
family estates to his illegitimate children, instead of
to his brother, who succeeded him in the title, although
his wife, on her side, claimed for her son that,
as he was born during her first husband&#8217;s lifetime,
he had a legal right to the title of Banbury. Accordingly,
this son changed his surname to Knollys,
and once actually sat, as Lord Banbury, in the House
of Lords. As is well known, his descendants went
on claiming and disputing the title until the year
1813, when their right to it was finally disallowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>But what specially concerns my story is that Sir
Everard Digby was endeavouring to bring about a
marriage for this (then) very young Lord Vaux, with
the &#8220;Lord Chamberlain his daughter,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> as Father
Gerard writes; and, in a footnote, is added &#8220;Earl
of Suffolk. Erased in Orig.&#8221;If this footnote is
right, Sir Everard was probably trying to make a
match for the youth with the very girl whom he
eventually married, as Lady Banbury had been
Elizabeth Howard, the eldest daughter of Lord
Suffolk. Suffolk was Lord Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and
curiously enough (when we consider that he seems
to have had negotiations with Sir Everard Digby
with respect to a match between his daughter and
Lord Vaux), in his capacity of Lord Chamberlain,
he suspected and led to the discovery of the gunpowder
laid in the cellar beneath the Houses of
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Sir Everard visited a good deal at the house of Lord
Vaux&#8217;s mother, Mrs Elizabeth Vaux. This was a
house in Buckinghamshire at Stoke Poges, that had
been built by Sir Christopher Hatton,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> the Lord
Chancellor, who had died childless. It was let for a
term of years to Mrs Vaux, and she not only estab<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>lished
Father Gerard in it as her chaplain, but had
hiding-places and other arrangements made, so that
he could receive priests and Catholic laymen, as he
might think well, for the good of the cause of religion.
Here Sir Everard was probably thrown a good deal
with Catesby and Tresham, as they were both related
to his young host. Lord Vaux&#8217;s two aunts, Miss
Anne Vaux and Eleanor, the wife of Edward Brooksby,
lived with him and his mother, and Miss Anne was
one of those who had serious misgivings as to the
mysterious conduct of her cousin, Robert Catesby.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
&#8220;Seeing at Winter&#8217;s and Grant&#8217;s&#8221;&mdash;Grant was a
popular Warwickshire squire, a Catholic, and celebrated
for his undaunted courage&mdash;&#8220;their fine horses in the
stable, she told Mr Garnet that she feared these wild
heads had something in hand, and prayed him to talk
to Mr Catesby and to hinder anything that possibly
he might, for if they should attempt any foolish
thing, it would redound to his discredit. Whereupon
he said he would talk to Mr Catesby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another account of what was probably the same
interview was given by Father Garnet himself, in his
examination of March 12th, 1605.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>&#8220;He sayth that Mrs Vaux came to him, eyther to
Harrowden or to Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s at Gothurst,
and tould this exam<sup>t</sup>. that she feared that some
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>trouble or disorder was towards [them], that some of
the gentlewomen had demanded of her where they
should bestow themselves until the burst<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> was past
in the beginning of the Parliament. And this exam<sup>t</sup>.
asking her who tould her so, she said that she durst
not tell who tould her so: she was [choked] with
sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>An attempt was made, later, to represent the name
of Vaux to be the same as that of Fawkes:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> &#8220;Mrs
Anne Vaux, or Fawkes, probably a relative of the
conspirator;&#8221;for which there seems to be no
foundation, and certainly there is none for the base
imputation, in the same paragraph, of immorality
between Anne Vaux and Father Garnet. Even the
Protestant historian, Jardine, repudiates this calumny
at considerable length.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>In the summer of the year 1605, Sir Everard Digby
spent a week in London, and stayed at the lodgings
in the Savoy of his friend Roger Manners,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the eldest
brother of Sir Oliver Manners, whose conversion to
the Catholic faith has been already noticed. This
Roger Manners married the daughter and heir of the
famous Sir Philip Sydney, and eventually succeeded
his father, as fifth Earl of Rutland. Although Sir
Everard stayed with Roger Manners, he &#8220;commonlie
dieted at the Mearmaid in Bred Streete.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He spent
much of his time with the excellent Sir Oliver Manners,
which was all very well; but, unfortunately, Robert
Catesby also &#8220;kept him companie&#8221;a great deal;
without, however, letting him know what was chiefly
occupying him in London just at that time. Thomas
Winter also came to see Sir Everard whilst he was in
London, and his friendship with men who were conspiring
to an evil end was endangering Digby without
his knowing it. At that time he had no idea that
any plot was in existence, although he was doubtless
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>aware that many Catholics were considering what
steps could be taken to relieve their condition; and
the fact of his staying with Roger Manners proves
that he had not come to London with any design of
conferring with restless Catholics in a secret or underhand
fashion.</p>

<p>After his visit to London, Sir Everard seems to
have returned to Gothurst and to have continued his
usual innocent country life, with its duties and
pleasures. A letter among the Hatfield MS., written
to him on the eleventh of June&mdash;his eldest boy&#8217;s
birthday by the way<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>&mdash;treats of otter-hunting, and
it is likely enough that Sir Everard practised this
sport in the Ouse as well as in the other rivers and
brooks of Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>About the end of August, or perhaps early in
September, 1605, a large party met at Gothurst, as
guests of Sir Everard and Lady Digby, but with an
ulterior purpose. To pray for the much-oppressed
cause of the Catholic religion in England, for their
suffering fellow-religionists, and for themselves, they
had agreed to make a pilgrimage together to the
famous shrine of St Winefride at Holywell, in Flintshire,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
which would entail a journey of a hundred and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>fifty miles.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Sir Everard does not appear to have
accompanied it; but, among those assembled at
Gothurst who were to go on the pilgrimage were
his young wife, Miss Anne Vaux, Brooksby and
his wife, Thomas Digby, Sir Everard&#8217;s brother, who
had evidently followed his example and become a
Catholic, Sir Francis Lacon and his daughter, Father
Garnet, the Provincial of the Jesuits, a lay-brother
named Nicholas Owen, who usually accompanied
him, and Father Strange, Sir Everard&#8217;s chaplain,
making, with their servants and others, a party
of pilgrims numbering little short of thirty. Later
on, Father Darcy and Father Fisher also joined
them.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>If, as it seems, Sir Everard did not go with the
pilgrimage, the reason may have been that he was
engaged in endeavouring to negotiate the proposed
marriage between young Lord Vaux and a daughter
of the Earl of Suffolk, although it seemed early
to do so, as the boy was then only about
fourteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Riding westward,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> the party of pilgrims would
stop for the night at some Catholic friend&#8217;s house,
and in the morning the two priests would say Mass.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>
Even at Shrewsbury, when they had to put up at an
inn, and at &#8216;a castle in a holt at Denbighshire,&#8217; the
daily Masses were said without interruption, and
even the servants were present. At St Winefride&#8217;s
Well, too, though the inn must have been small for so
large a number, the Holy Sacrifice was again offered,
and then the ladies went barefoot to the Well.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> At
Holywell they stopped but one night. Returning
next day, they slept at a farmhouse seven miles from
Shrewsbury, and after that they were again in the
circle of their friends.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>About the end of September (1605) Sir Everard
Digby went to stay at Harrowden with young Lord
Vaux. While he was there, his host&#8217;s mother, her
sister-in-law, Anne Vaux, and Father Garnet came
thither on their return from the pilgrimage. His
friend Catesby also arrived from a visit to Lord
Mordaunt<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> at Turville. Anne Vaux, who, as I have
said, had been uneasy about Catesby&#8217;s proceedings,
was in a hurry for his departure to Flanders, where
he was to command an English regiment. Father
Garnet wrote a letter of introduction for him to
a Jesuit priest in that country, and Catesby
himself showed this letter to his nervous cousin,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>assuring her that he was so anxious to start that
he would spend £500 in obtaining a license<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> to go
abroad with his men and horses, about which, he
pretended, there was some difficulty.</p>

<p>After a few days&#8217; visit at Harrowden, the family
seat of the Vaux&#8217;s, which was then in a rather
dilapidated condition,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Sir Everard Digby invited
Catesby, Mrs Vaux, and Father Garnet to stay with
him at Gothurst; and he started with Catesby to
ride home, leaving his other guests to follow them.
The distance between Harrowden and Gothurst was
something like fifteen miles, and Digby and his
friend became very confidential in the course of
it.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are few occasions on which it is
easier to converse freely than a long ride with a
single companion; in most cases, no one can possibly
be within earshot, therefore the voice need not be
unnaturally lowered; the speakers are not confronting
each other, and this prevents any nervous dread
lest the mention of subjects on which either feels
strongly should raise a tell-tale blush or a quiver
of a lip or eyelid; and, if the topic should become
embarrassing, the surroundings of those on horseback
enable them to change it more easily, and with less
apparent effort or intention, than under almost any
other conditions. Lastly, the fresh country air, as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>it is inhaled in the easy exercise of riding, clears
the brain and invigorates the energies, and when is
it fresher or pleasanter than on a fine day at the
end of September, such as we can imagine Sir
Everard Digby and Robert Catesby to have enjoyed
on their ride from Harrowden to Gothurst? Both
of them, as we read, were fine men, fine horsemen on
fine horses, and old friends; and they must have
made a handsome and well-assorted pair, as they
went their way along the roads, through the woods,
and over the commons of Northamptonshire and
Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>Early in their ride, when they were well clear of the
outskirts of the little market town of Wellingborough,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
beside the famous Red Well of which, some twenty
years later, Charles I. and his Queen were to dwell in
tents, in order to drink its medicinal waters, Catesby
told his companion that he had a communication
of the greatest importance to make to him; that he
was only at liberty to convey it upon an oath of
secresy; and that from all others intrusted with
the subject of this communication, the oath had
not been accepted unless sealed and confirmed by
Holy Communion&mdash;which alone would demonstrate
its sacred and religious nature&mdash;but that, in the case
of so honourable a man as Digby, a simple oath
would suffice. This was paying a very flattering compliment,
and, when Catesby drew a small poignard,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>handed it to him, and asked him to swear secresy
upon it,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Sir Everard, thinking that the matter would
concern some &#8220;stirres in Wales&#8221;on behalf of the
persecuted Catholics, of which Catesby had talked at
Gothurst during the summer, took the oath without
much hesitation, and returned the little weapon.</p>

<p>Then Catesby began a long, earnest, and serious
discourse. There can be little doubt that he would
first dwell upon the desperate condition of their co-religionists
in Great Britain, the hopelessness of
redress or any improvement in their state, and the
likelihood of their persecution becoming still more
intolerable under the incoming parliament. At last,
he told his patient and sympathetic listener that
the time had come for action. They could expect
no help from the king, no help from the parliament,
no help from foreign Catholic princes or powers, no
help from a general, an ordinary, and a legitimate
rising among their Catholic fellow-countrymen; there
was nothing for it, therefore, but to help themselves.
It was plain enough where, and from whom, their
greatest danger lay. The few must be sacrificed to
save the many. He had been reading his Bible<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>&mdash;the
very Protestants who so cruelly oppressed them
would commend that&mdash;and there he found instances
in which the deliberate assassination of tyrants
appeared to be not only tolerated but commended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>I cannot guarantee that Catesby said exactly all
these things to Digby; I merely enumerate the
arguments which he is stated, on good authority, to
have used in persuading those who joined in his plot;
and it is well known that he found no other of his
adherents so difficult to convince as Sir Everard;
therefore it is most unlikely that he omitted one
of his pleas in this case.</p>

<p>Between the Catholics and the Protestants, Catesby
considered that there was a regular warfare; no war
could be conducted without bloodshed, and in war
all was fair. It might even be maintained that the
righteous Catholics were in the position of executioners,
who should carry out the extreme sentence
of death upon the iniquitous and murderous villains
who, under the names of princes and rulers, were
persecuting and slaying God&#8217;s innocent people. Who
were these princes and rulers? King James and
his parliament. They richly deserved to die the
death, and unless they were destroyed they would
work even greater evils. Let the sword of justice
fall upon them.</p>

<p>Were the Catholics to rise and invade the houses
of parliament with drawn sabres? No. Such a
thing would be impossible. Resort must be had
to stratagem, a method to which holy men had
often resorted in ancient times, as might be read
in the sacred pages of the Old Testament. But,
unlike the warriors of Israel, the modern Christian<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
soldier fought less with the sword than with that
much more powerful medium known as gunpowder.
It had already been the principal agent of destruction
in many great battles; let it be used in the
strife between the oppressed English Catholics and
the king with his parliament.</p>

<p>Before entering into details of the proposed attack,
it would be well to consider that the end aimed at
was not any private revenge or personal emolument.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
The sole object was to suppress a most unjust and
barbarous persecution by the only expedient which
offered the least prospect of success. There could be
no doubt as to its being lawful, since God had given
to every man the right of repelling force by force.
If Digby should consider the scheme cruel, let him
contrast it with the cruelties exercised during so
many years against the English Catholics; let him
calculate the number of innocent martyrs who had
been butchered by the public executioner, or had died
from ill-treatment or torture in prisons; let him
estimate the thousands who had been reduced by
the penal laws against recusants, from wealth or
competence, to poverty or beggary; and then let
him judge whether the sudden destruction of the
rulers who had been guilty of such fearful persecutions,
and avowedly intended persecutions yet more
atrocious, could be condemned on the charge of
cruelty. Nay, more; unless a decisive blow were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>delivered very shortly, something like a massacre of
Catholics might be expected, and,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> &#8220;Mr Catesby tould
him that the papistes throate should have been cutte.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catesby would then tell his friend and companion,
as they rode through the peaceful Midland scenery,
with its horse-chestnuts and its beeches in their rich
autumn colouring, on that September afternoon, how
he must be a man, and nerve himself to hear the
means which it was proposed to employ for carrying
out the judgment of God upon their wicked oppressors.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Every Catholic peer was to be warned, or enticed
from the House of Lords on a certain day, and then,
by the sudden explosion of a large quantity of gunpowder,
previously placed beneath the Houses of
Parliament, the king and his councillors, his Lords
and his Commons, were to be prevented from doing
any further mischief in this world. As soon as the
execution was over, the Catholics would<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> &#8220;seize upon
the person of the young prince, if he were not in
the Parliament House, which they much desired.
But if he were,&#8221;in which case, of course, he would
be dead, &#8220;then upon the young Duke Charles, who
then should be the next heir, and him they would
erect, and with him and by his authority, the Catholic
religion. If that did also fail them, then had they
a resolution to take the Lady Elizabeth, who was in
the keeping of the Lord Harrington in Warwickshire;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>and so by one means or other, they would be certain
to settle in the crown one of the true heirs of the
same.&#8221;How loyal they were!</p>

<p>On first hearing of this inhuman, detestable, and
diabolical scheme, Sir Everard was overcome with
horror, as well he might be, and it was with the
greatest difficulty that Catesby induced him to
consider it any further.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> If Sir Everard had been a
man of firm will and determination of character, he
would have obeyed his conscience and resolutely
followed his own good instincts; but instead of doing
so, he was weak enough to listen with attention and
interest to the arguments of Catesby. To a man of
a religious mind like Sir Everard Digby, those of a
Scriptural character would be some of the most
persuasive, and his companion would hardly fail to
point out the wholesale massacres and cruelties
apparently sanctioned in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>If he so pleased, he could quote plenty of biblical
precedents for slaying and maiming, on a far larger
scale than was proposed in the Gunpowder Plot,
which would be a mere trifle in comparison with some
of the following butcheries:&mdash;&#8220;They warred against
the Midianites,&#8221;&#8220;and they slew all the males. And
they slew the kings of Midian.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> &#8220;They slew of
them in Bezek ten thousand men.&#8221;&#8220;And they slew
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>of Moab at that time ten thousand men, all lusty,
and all men of valour; and there escaped not a
man.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> &#8220;David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
thousand.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> &#8220;The other Jews,&#8221;&#8220;slew of their foes
seventy and five thousand.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> &#8220;Pekah the son of
Remaliah slew in Juda an hundred and twenty
thousand in one day, which were all valiant men,
because they had forsaken the Lord God of their
fathers,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> just as King James and the English
Government had forsaken Him, in Catesby&#8217;s and Sir
Everard&#8217;s opinions.</p>

<p>If it were objected that all these fell in battle, and
that it was quite a different thing to murder people
by stealth in cold blood, could not Catesby have
replied that &#8220;Jael Heber&#8217;s wife took a nail of the
tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went
softly unto him [Sisera], and smote the nail into
his temple, and fastened it into the ground: for he
was fast asleep and weary. So he died.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Jael
Heber&#8217;s wife was acting as hostess to a friend who
had come into her tent for shelter and protection,
and had fallen asleep. Yet Deborah and Barak sang
in honour of this performance:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> &#8220;Blessed above
women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>forth butter in a lordly dish. She put her hand
to the nail, and her right hand to the workman&#8217;s
hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera,
she smote off his head, when she had pierced and
stricken through his temples. At her feet he bowed,
he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell:
where he bowed, there he fell down dead.&#8221;&#8220;So let
all thine enemies perish, O Lord.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Might not, and
ought not, the English Catholics to sing much such
a song in honour of Catesby, Digby, and their fellow-conspirators,
when the king and the Parliament should
be blown up, and fall, and lie down, at their feet,
where they should fall down dead? Was there not
something biblical and appropriate, again, in destroying
the enemies of the Lord with fire? &#8220;Behold,
they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
&#8220;Thou shalt be fuel for the fire; thy blood shall be
in the midst of the land.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And had not the very
gentlest of men, even the God-man, said, &#8220;I am come
to send fire on the earth?&#8221;Surely, too, if Holy
Writ did not specially mention gunpowder, it constantly
threatened one of its ingredients, namely
brimstone, to the wicked!</p>

<p>Under the old dispensation, it was considered a
religious duty to fall upon the enemies of the Lord
and slay them; under the new, it would be as
religious a duty to get under them and slay them.
This was merely a detail, a simple reversal of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>process, conducing to exactly the same results, and
quite as Scriptural in its character.</p>

<p>A massacre by means of an explosion of gunpowder
was neither a novel nor an exclusively Catholic
notion. Persons observed, &#8220;There be recounted in
histories many attempts of the same kynds, and some
also by Protestants in our days: as that of them who
at Antwerp placed a whole barke of powder in the
great street of that citty, where the prince of Parma
with his nobility was to passe: and that of him in
the Hague that would have blown up the whole
councel of Holland upon private revenge.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Within the last half century, had not great earls
and statesmen, in Scotland, conspired together to
blow up with gunpowder the Queen&#8217;s own husband,
as he lay ill in bed, in his house; had not four men
been destroyed by this means,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and had not the
principal conspirator &#8220;declared,&#8221;with how much
truth or falsehood it is not necessary to pause here to
inquire,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> &#8220;that the Queen&#8221;&mdash;the very pious martyr-queen,
Mary, herself,&mdash;&#8220;was a consenting party to
the deed,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and had not that very pious queen
married that very conspirator after he had brought
about the murder of her first husband?</p>

<p>It would be scarcely too much to say that, early in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>the seventeenth century, the ethics of explosives were
not properly understood. Catesby might argue that
gunpowder was a destructive agent, the primary and
natural use of which was to kill directly, and that its
indirect use, by exploding it in a tube, thereby propelling
a missile, was a secondary, less natural, and
possibly less legitimate use. And, if it were objected
that to employ it in either way would be right in
war, but wrong in peace, he could bring forward the
exceedingly dangerous theory (which has been made
use of by Irish-American dynamitards in the nineteenth
century), that oppressed people, who do not
acknowledge the authority of those who rule over
them, may consider themselves at war with those
authorities, a theory which Catesby&#8217;s Jesuit friends
would have negatived instantly, if he had asked
their opinion about it.</p>

<p>Any attempt to prove the iniquity of Catesby&#8217;s
conspiracy is so unnecessary that I will not waste
time in offering one. I have only to endeavour to
imagine the condition of mind in which he and his
friends were able to look upon it with approval,
and the arguments they may have used in its
favour.</p>

<p>Next to passages and precedents from Scripture in
support of his diabolical scheme, Catesby would be
well aware that its approval by authorities of the
Church, and especially by Fathers of the Society of
Jesus, would have most influence with his friend Sir<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>
Everard. To the surprise of the latter, he informed
him that he had laid the matter before the Provincial
of the Society, and had obtained his consent to the
scheme.</p>

<p>He admitted that the Jesuits were not fully aware
of all the particulars; it was not intended to put them
to the dangers of responsibility for the deed itself,
or anything connected with it; already their very
priesthood was high treason, and the last thing that
Catesby and his friends desired was to add to their
perils; but their approval of the design in general
was of such importance that neither Catesby himself,
nor any of those admitted into the secret, would
have acted without it, and this Catesby declared he
had obtained.</p>

<p>Upon a zealous convert, like Sir Everard Digby,
such an assurance would exercise a great influence.
Nor was it only of sacerdotal approval that Catesby
boasted; he was able to add that he had obtained the
consent, as well as the assistance, of John Wright, a
Catholic layman and a Yorkshire squire; of Sir
Everard&#8217;s own friend, Thomas Winter; of his eldest
brother, Robert Winter,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> &#8220;an earnest Catholic,&#8221;at
whose house the pilgrims to St Winefride&#8217;s Well had
stayed for a night on their way thither; of Ambrose
Rookwood, a Catholic,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> &#8220;ever very devout,&#8221;who had
actually been one of the pilgrims; of John Grant,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> &#8220;a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>zealous Roman Catholic,&#8221;who, like his brother-in-law,
Robert Winter, had entertained the St Winifride&#8217;s
pilgrims for a night in his walled and moated house,
and of Thomas Percy, a relative of the Earl of
Northumberland&#8217;s, and a very recent and earnest
convert to the Church.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>Believing that his principal friends, and the priests
for whom he felt the greatest veneration, had either
joined in or expressed their approval of the scheme,
Sir Everard began to be half inclined to consent to it.
Was there to be a great enterprise, entailing personal
activity and danger for the good of the Catholic cause,
and was he to shrink from taking part in it? Was
he alone, among the most zealous Catholic laymen of
England, to show the white feather in a time of peril?
Could he call himself a man if he trembled at the
very thought of bloodshed? Yet, in truth, the idea
of the cold-blooded massacre which was proposed
appalled him; fair fighting he would rather rejoice
in, but wholesale assassination was to the last degree
repulsive to his nature. Hesitating and miserable, he
reached Gothurst with his guest without giving any
definite answer to the question whether he would join
in the conspiracy.</p>

<p>When they were in the house, Catesby showed him
a book justifying proceedings which he claimed to be
similar to the proposed plot. &#8220;I saw,&#8221;he wrote after<span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>wards
to his wife,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> &#8220;I saw the principal point of the
case, judged by a Latin book of M. D., my brother&#8217;s
father-in-law.&#8221;What book it may have been we have
no means of knowing; but we do know that the perils
of comparing parallel cases are notorious: and, unfortunately,
the production of this book had the effect
of turning the scale, and inducing Digby to join in the
infamous plot.</p>

<p>Necessary as it is for a biographer of Sir Everard
Digby carefully to consider all the arguments that are
likely to have influenced him in consenting to the
Gunpowder Plot, it is all-important to keep before
the mind the cause which, on his own admission,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
was the first and most potent of his assent to the
conspiracy. This was<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> &#8220;the friendship and love he
bare to Catesby, which prevailed so much, and was
so powerful with him, as that for his sake he was
ever contented and ready to hazard himself and his
estate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard was a man of what may be termed violent
friendship. We have already seen his almost immoderate
attachment to Father Gerard. It was an
excellent thing that he should have such a man for
a firm friend; but his feeling towards him was something
much more than that. Father Gerard was &#8220;his
brother.&#8221;The Jesuits make a rule of avoiding what
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>they term &#8220;particular friendships,&#8221;and the great
aggression of affection would certainly not come from
Father Gerard&#8217;s side. And now we find him loving
Catesby to such an extent as to be &#8220;ready to hazard
himself and his estate&#8221;&#8220;for his sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is such a thing as an undue admiration for
&#8220;the man who thinks as I do.&#8221;It proceeds from a
combination of pride and weakness. The man in
question is the embodiment of &#8220;my&#8221;principles, and
therefore to be worshipped, and, holding &#8220;my&#8221;principles,
his decisions, which are presumably formed upon
those principles, must be right, and &#8220;my&#8221;adoption of
them will save me the trouble of forming any for myself.
Such is the line of argument which men of Sir
Everard Digby&#8217;s type mentally follow. When, again,
some difficulty presents itself, concerning which they
have never thought at all, they argue to themselves
after this fashion. &#8220;My friend agrees with me about
A, B, and C, topics on which we are both well informed;
therefore I may safely follow his advice about
D, a subject of which I at present know nothing, but
about which, when I have studied it, I may logically
assume that I shall agree with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few men act on principle at first hand. To a vast
majority, it is too invisible, intangible, difficult to define,
and difficult to realise, to serve as either a guide or a
support. Yet some of those who are least able, coolly,
logically, and consistently to understand and adhere to
a principle in the abstract, are the most enthusiastic in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
advocating, the most vigorous in defending, and the most
extravagant in extending to the most extreme limits,
its reflection, or supposed reflection, in the person and
behaviour of a friend; and they are apt, in their
devotion to the friend, to forget the principle. It
was thus in the case of Sir Everard Digby and Robert
Catesby. In his friendship with Catesby, Sir Everard
was eager to be one of the most pronounced champions
of the Catholic religion, yet when Catesby acted in
direct opposition to the fundamental principles of
that religion, Sir Everard clung to the visible friend
to the neglect of the invisible principle, which,
theoretically, he held to be more precious than life
itself.</p>

<p>When one idea takes too forcible possession of the
mind, although the objections to it may collectively
be overpowering, if taken one by one, it is easy to
dispose of them, and then to blind the eyes, to stifle
the conscience, and to imagine a glamour of righteousness,
unselfishness, and heroism, in iniquity, self-pleasing,
and even cruelty. Digby experienced this
fatal facility. He did not at once consent to
Catesby&#8217;s request without the least pretence of considering
its merits; but he combatted the objections
to it one by one, and thus easily defeated them. He
endeavoured to regard the matter from Catesby&#8217;s
point of view, and he found the process simple, if not
agreeable.</p>

<p>And here let me say that I wish I could honestly<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
represent Sir Everard as having consented hurriedly
to the plot in a hot-headed love of adventure. The
evidence, unfortunately, all points the other way.
He was persuaded with great difficulty by Catesby.
He disliked the look of the whole thing, and he finally
consented to it after cool and deliberate reflection. I
admit that he was impulsive; I do not deny that, in
this instance, he may have acted on sudden impulse
at particular stages of his lengthened agony of doubt
and indecision, or that, after being too slow in
obeying his first impulse to refuse to hear another
word about the atrocious project, he may have
yielded too hurriedly to his later impulse to throw
in his lot with the friend whom he trusted; but I
cannot excuse him on the ground that his adhesion to
the conspiracy was the result of a momentary convulsion
of enthusiastic folly.</p>

<p>He objected; he feared the destruction of Catholic
peers; he talked over the pretended opinions of the
Jesuit Fathers; he read a so-called authority in a
book shown to him by Catesby; he calculated the
chances of success and failure; he thought over the
question of men, money, arms, and horses; and then,
with false conclusions, on false premises, in a sort of
spasm of wrongheadedness, he, who had been depending
excessively on clerical direction&mdash;even Jesuits
admit that there is such a thing as being over-directed&mdash;suddenly
acted, upon a question involving an
enormous issue, without any advice whatever except<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>
that of the man who was tempting him to what, he
must have seen, had, <i>prima facie</i>, the colour of a most
odious crime. I am not forgetting that Catesby
vaunted Jesuit approval; but what good Catholic
would take clerical advice upon an intricate point at
second hand from another layman? Or, to put it in
another form, what prudent man would commit himself
to a lawsuit simply because a friend told him that
his lawyer recommended him to sue an adversary
under very similar circumstances? Digby had good
reason for knowing that the Jesuit Father, whose
opinion he most valued&mdash;Father Gerard&mdash;would
strongly object to what was proposed; but he fancied
that he himself knew better what was for the good of
the Church; so, after meekly wavering in a state of
great uncertainty, like the weak man that he was, he
suddenly yielded and agreed to partake in what he
persuaded himself to be a pious act on behalf of his
religion, but was in reality a piece of unprecedented
pious folly; and few things are more certain than
that, be his personal virtues ever so exalted, and his
intentions ever so pure, the pious fool can do, and
often does, more to injure the cause of religion than
even the scientific fool to injure that of science, which
is saying much.</p>

<p>It is now my duty to explain how grossly Sir
Everard was deceived by Catesby, when he was
assured that any Jesuit Fathers had approved of the
conspiracy &#8220;in general, though they knew not the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>
particulars.&#8221;What I am about to write may appear
a long digression; but it should be remembered that
it was chiefly upon Catesby&#8217;s assurance of the approval
of the Fathers of the Society of Jesus that Sir
Everard consented to join in the conspiracy; therefore
the amount of consent actually obtained from
them, if any, is of the utmost importance to my
story.</p>

<p>Here is Father Gerard&#8217;s account of the so-called
approval of the plot, which Catesby had extracted
from Father Garnet, and on the strength of which he
persuaded Sir Everard Digby and others to join in it.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
&#8220;Having a great opinion both of the learning and
virtue of the Fathers of the Society, Mr Catesby
desired to get, by cunning means, the judgment of
their Superior, so as he should never perceive to what
end the question were asked.&#8221;This makes Father
Gerard&#8217;s opinion of Catesby&#8217;s shameful dishonesty
in the affair unmistakably clear. &#8220;Therefore,&#8221;he
continues, &#8220;coming to Father Garnet, after much
ordinary talk, and some time passed over after his
arrival&#8221;(at a house in Essex, in June 1605, that is to
say, about three months before he revealed the plot to
Sir Everard) &#8220;one time he took occasion (upon some
speech proposed about the wars in the Low Countries
or such like)&#8221;&mdash;observe the fraud of this! Catesby
was to have command of a regiment in the &#8220;Low
Countries,&#8221;so he clearly intended to lead Father<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
Garnet to suppose that he was contemplating a
position in which he might very probably find himself
when <i>there</i>&mdash;&#8220;to ask how far it might be lawful for
the party that hath the just quarrel to proceed in
sacking or destroying a town of the enemy&#8217;s, or fortress,
when it is holden against them by strong hands.
The Father answered that, in a just war, it was lawful
for those that had right to wage battle against the
enemies of the commonwealth, to authorise their
captains or soldiers, as their officers, to annoy or
destroy any town that is unjustly holden against
them, and that such is the common doctrine of all
Divines: in respect that every commonwealth must,
by the Law of Nature, be sufficient for itself, and
therefore as well able to repel injuries as to provide
necessaries; and that, as a private person may <i>vim
vi repellere</i>, so may the commonwealth do the like
with so much more right, as the whole is of more
importance than a part; which, if it were not true, it
should follow that Nature had provided better for
beasts than for men, furnishing them with natural
weapons as well to offend as to defend themselves,
which we see also they have a natural instinct to use,
when the offence of the invader is necessary for their
own defence. And therefore that it is not fit to think
that God, Who, by natural reason, doth provide in a
more universal and more noble manner for men than
by natural instinct for beasts, hath left any particular
person, and much less a commonwealth, without<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span>
sufficient means to defend and conserve itself; and
therefore not without power to provide and use likely
means to repel present injuries, and to repress known
and hurtful enemies. And that, in all these, the head
of the commonwealth may judge what is expedient and
needful for the body thereof.&#8221;Much of all this was
useless to Catesby&#8217;s purpose; but he waited patiently,
and when Father Garnet had finished speaking, he
answered, &#8220;that all this seemed to be plain in common
reason, and the same also practised by all well-governed
commonwealths that ever have been, were
they never so pious or devout. But, said he, some put
the greatest difficulty in the sackage of towns and
overthrowing or drowning up (<i>sic</i>) of forts, which, in
the Low Countries&#8221;&mdash;the Low Countries again!
mark his deceitfulness&mdash;&#8220;and in all wars is endeavoured,
when the fort cannot otherwise be surprised,
and the same of great importance to be taken. How,
then, those who have right to make the war may justify
that destruction of the town or fort, wherein there be
many innocents and young children, and some perhaps
unchristened, which must needs perish withal? Unto
this the Father answered, that indeed therein was the
greatest difficulty; and that it was a thing could never
be lawful in itself, to kill an innocent, for that the
reason ceaseth in them for which the pain of death
may be inflicted by authority, seeing the cause why a
malefactor and enemy to the commonwealth may be put
to death is in respect of the common good, which is to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
be preferred before his private (for otherwise, considering
the thing only in itself, it were not lawful to put
any man to death); and so because the malefactor doth
<i>in re gravi</i> hinder the common good, therefore by the
authority of the magistrate that impediment may be
removed. But now, as for the innocent and good, their
life is a help and furtherance to the common good, and
therefore in no sort it can be lawful to kill or destroy
an innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Determined as Catesby was to twist Father Garnet&#8217;s
words into &#8220;a parallel case,&#8221;he wanted something
more tangible than this to work upon. Accordingly
he said:&mdash;&#8220;That is done ordinarily in the destruction
of the forts I spake of.&#8221;&#8220;It is true, said the Father,
it is there permitted, because it cannot be avoided;
but is done as <i>per accidens</i>, and not as a thing intended
by or for itself, and so it is not unlawful. As
if we were shot into the arm with a poisoned bullet,
so that we could not escape with life unless we cut off
our arm; then <i>per accidens</i> we cut off our hand and
fingers also which were sound, and yet being, at that
time of danger, inseparably joined to the arm, lawful
to be cut off, which it were not lawful otherwise to do
without mortal sin. And such was the case of the
town of Gabaa, and the other towns of the tribe of
Benjamin, wherein many were destroyed that had not
offended. With which Mr Catesby, seeming fully
satisfied, brake presently into other talk, the Father
at that time little imagining at what he aimed, though<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
afterwards, when the matter was known, he told some
friends what had passed between Mr Catesby and him
about this matter, and that he little suspected then
he would so have applied the general doctrine of
Divines to the practice of a private and so perilous a
case, without expressing all particulars, which course
may give occasion of great errors, as we see it did in
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Sir Everard Digby had heard the conversation
on which the vaunted &#8220;consent&#8221;of the Jesuits had
been founded, there can be little doubt that he would
have refused to have anything to do with the conspiracy
on such grounds. Father Gerard probably
heard the account of the interview, after the failure of
the plot, from Father Garnet himself.</p>

<p>Father Garnet&#8217;s own much shorter account of the
conversation may be given here.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Mr Catesby &#8220;asked
me whether, in case it were lawful to kill a person or
persons, it were necessary to regard the innocents,
which were present, lest they also should perish
withal. I answered that in all just wars it is practised
and held lawful to beat down houses and walls
and castles, notwithstanding innocents were in danger,
so that such battering were necessary for the obtaining
of victory, and that the multitude of innocents, or the
harm which might ensue by their death, were not
such that it might countervail the gain and com<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>modity
of the victory. And in truth I never imagined
anything of the King&#8217;s Majesty, nor of any particular,
and thought it, as it were, an idle question, till I saw
him, when we had done, make solemn protestation
that he would never be known to have asked me any
such question as long as he lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Father Garnet believed Catesby to have
deceived him and to have told untruths about him is
evident from one of his letters written in orange juice
in the Tower. He says<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> &#8220;Master Catesby did me
much wrong, and hath confessed that he tould
them that he said he asked me a question in Q.
Eliz. time of the powder action, and that it was
unlawfull. All which is most untrew. He did it to
draw in others.&#8221;Again he writes<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> &#8220;I doubt not Mr
Catesby hath fained many such things for to induce
others,&#8221;Sir Everard Digby, of course, among the
rest.</p>

<p>Some of the modern admirers of Father Garnet
have maintained that the worse Catesby, the worse
Garnet; the better Catesby, the better Garnet.
Without suggesting the exact converse, I would venture
to point out the danger to Garnet&#8217;s memory in
anything that might tend to show some sort of co-partnership
in spirit and intention between himself
and Catesby. All the facts lead me to a very different
conclusion, and one which is much more to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>interest of Garnet&#8217;s memory, namely, that Catesby
deceived him from first to last, and that he was, in
fact, the innocent dupe of Catesby. To begin with,
Catesby, when, during the first half year of James&#8217;s
reign, Garnet desired him not to join in &#8220;some
stirring, seeing the King kept not his promise,&#8221;deceived
Garnet by assuring him &#8220;he would not.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> He
deceived him in 1604, when, on Garnet&#8217;s urging him
not to take up arms, etc., against the king,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> &#8220;he promised
to surcease.&#8221;He deceived him when he put a
case before him on the question of slaying &#8220;innocents
together with nocents,&#8221;as if it concerned his projected
campaign in Flanders, when it really concerned the
Gunpowder Plot. He deceived him at the<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> &#8220;house
in Essex,&#8221;when he &#8220;assured&#8221;him &#8220;that all his plans
were unexceptionable.&#8221;He deceived him when he<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
&#8220;promised&#8221;&#8220;to do nothing before the Pope was
informed by&#8221;&#8220;messenger.&#8221;He deceived him at
White Webbs, when he told him that what he had
in hand was quite &#8220;lawfull.&#8221;He deceived him at
Harrowden when he said that he was going to start
for the war in the Low Countries as soon as he
possibly could.</p>

<p>In other places I either have shown, or will show,
that he deceived all his fellow-conspirators, that he
induced them to join in the plot on false pretences,
and that he told the lie direct to Sir Everard Digby
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>at Dunchurch. Undoubtedly he had a charming
manner, he was an agreeable and well-informed
companion; there is much in his history that is
interesting, much that is romantic, much that excites
pity, but let not any modern Catholics imagine that
by attempting to minimise his misdoings they will do
any credit to the cause of the Church; for the man
began as a libertine, and, after a period of spasmodic
piety, ended as a liar. Catesby was one of those
people who are fond of asking for priestly advice,
obey it only if it coincides with their own wishes, and
have no scruple whatever in misquoting it to their
friends. This race is not extinct, nor is it limited to
the male sex. Sometimes the performance is varied:
instead of misquoting the advice of the priest, these
candid penitents misstate the case on which they ask
the priest to form an opinion.</p>

<p>Such people are exceedingly dangerous, and do
immense mischief to the cause of the Catholic Church.
When we consider the evil that may be wrought by
one inaccurate and not over-scrupulous woman of this
sort, who says to her friends:&mdash;&#8220;Oh, you may be
quite easy in your mind. I asked Father Dash, and
he told me there was no harm whatever in it,&#8221;of
some action which that Father would have condemned
in the most unqualified terms, what limit can be
put to the disaster that a man like Catesby might
bring upon a credulous friend such as Sir Everard
Digby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>It is unfortunate that there should be men of the
Digby class as well as the Catesby! A priestly
judgment has to be given in a court in which the
inquirer is witness for both plaintiff and defendant,
as well as advocate for both plaintiff and defendant.
The friend, therefore, of the inquirer, who is asked
to accept the decision which he brings from that
spiritual court, ought not to do so unless he feels assured
either that he would lay his case with absolute
impartiality before that tribunal, or that the judge
would discredit his evidence if given with partiality.
Now, knowing Catesby very intimately, had Sir
Everard Digby good reasons for believing that he
could be trusted as an absolutely impartial witness
and an absolutely impartial advocate on both sides?
or else that the priest consulted would certainly
detect any flaw in the evidence of a man so notorious
for his plausibility and his powers of persuasion? If
not, and he was determined only to join in the enterprise
on the condition that it had priestly consent, he
was bound either to go and ask it for himself, or, if
his oath of secrecy prevented this, to refuse to have
anything further to do with the conspiracy. So far
as I have been able to ascertain of the previous
history of Robert Catesby, he was one of the very last
men from whom I should have felt inclined to take
spiritual advice or spiritual consent at second hand;
and, on this point, I find it difficult to exculpate Sir
Everard Digby, although the difficulty is somewhat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
qualified by an unhappy remark made to Sir Everard
by Father Garnet, to be noticed presently.</p>

<p>But first let us notice an incident which, in
the case of two men professing to be practical
Catholics, is nothing short of astounding! As a
modern Jesuit, the present editor of <i>The Month</i>, the
chief Jesuit journal in this country, points out,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
Catesby &#8220;peremptorily demanded of&#8221;his associates in
the conspiracy, of whom Sir Everard Digby was one,
&#8220;a promise that they would not mention the project
even in confession, lest their ghostly fathers should
discountenance and hinder it.&#8221;Considering that that
project, even when regarded in the most favourable
light, was one likely to entail very intricate questions
of conscience in the course of its preparation and its
fulfilment, it is inconceivable how men called, or calling
themselves, good Catholics could either make such a
demand or consent to it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>In the last chapter we saw how Catesby, by means of
his infamous perversion of Father Garnet&#8217;s words,
induced several of his friends, among others, and last
of all, Sir Everard Digby, to join in his conspiracy;
but even with his extraordinary powers of personal influence
and persuasion, his unscrupulousness, and his
intimate friendship with Sir Everard, it is just possible
that he might have failed in enlisting him as a conspirator,
had it not been for a most unfortunate, and
apparently unguarded, remark made by Father Garnet.</p>

<p>Garnet had been at his wits&#8217; end to put a stop to
the dangerous inclination to civil rebellion which he
had observed among certain of the English Catholics;
and, in his despair, he had written to Father Claudius
Aquaviva, the General of the Society of Jesus:<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>&mdash;&#8220;If
the affair of the toleration go not well, Catholics<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
will no more be quiet. What shall we do? Jesuits
cannot hinder it. Let the Pope forbid all Catholics
to stir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span></p><p>The date of this letter was August 29, 1604,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> that
is to say, more than a year before Sir Everard Digby
had ever heard of the Plot. Now, will it be believed
that when he was asked by Sir Everard Digby what
the meaning of &#8220;the Pope&#8217;s Brief was&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> [which
&#8220;Brief&#8221;it may have been matters little to my purpose;
Lingard<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> thought it referred to that of July
19, 1603], Father Garnet was weak enough&mdash;can
I use a milder term?&mdash;to reply &#8220;that they were not
(meaning Priests) to undertake or procure stirrs:
<i>but yet they would not hinder any, neither was it
the Pope&#8217;s mind they should, that should be undertaken
for Catholick good</i>.&#8221;And this after all his
anxiety that the Pope should be induced to &#8220;forbid all
Catholics to stir!&#8221;I say &#8220;after,&#8221;for if the conversation
had taken place very much earlier, what
reason would Sir Everard have had for saying:&mdash;&#8220;This
answer, with Mr <ins title="Original word Catesbyes"><a href="#TN">Catesby&#8217;s</a></ins> proceedings with
him and me gave me absolute belief that the matter
in general was approved, though every particular was
not known.&#8221;If the point be pressed that it <i>may</i>
have been earlier, I would reply, be it so; for in the
very initiatory stages of the Plot, Father Garnet
learned that some scheme was in hand, although he
knew nothing of its details, and even then he was
most anxious to prevent any &#8220;stirr.&#8221;Let me quote
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>Father Pollen.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> &#8220;About midsummer 1604, some
steps in the Plot having been already taken, Catesby
intimated that they had something in hand, but
entered into no particulars. Father Garnet dissuaded
him. Catesby answered, &#8216;Why were we commanded
before to keep out one that was not a Catholic, and
now may not exclude him?&#8217; And this he thought an
&#8216;invincible argument,&#8217; and &#8216;was so resolved in conscience
that it was lawful to take arms for religion,
that no man could dissuade it, but by the Pope&#8217;s
prohibition. Whereupon I [<i>i.e.</i>, Garnet] urged that
the Pope himself had given other orders, &amp;c.&#8217;&#8221;Yet
Garnet told Sir Everard Digby that priests &#8220;would
not hinder any&#8221;&#8220;stirs&#8221;&#8220;that should be undertaken
for the Catholick good,&#8221;&#8220;neither was it the
Pope&#8217;s mind that they should.&#8221;</p>

<p>A friend of my own, who is a great admirer of
Father Garnet, as well as a deeply read student of his
times, disagrees with me in my view of Father Garnet&#8217;s
speech to Sir Everard about the &#8220;stirrs.&#8221;He writes:&mdash;&#8220;It
seems to me you make too much of <i>one word</i>,
and not enough of the <i>known tenour</i> of his instructions.&#8221;
Well, in the first place, this one word is the chief
thing that I have to deal with, in respect to Father
Garnet. I am not writing a life of Garnet, but of
Sir Everard Digby; and as Sir Everard stated that on
that one word, to a great extent, depended his belief
that the plot was approved of by the Jesuits, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>consequently his consent to join in that plot, it is
scarcely possible for me to &#8220;make too much of it.&#8221;
Moreover, I expressly pointed out that it was contrary
to &#8220;the known tenour of his instructions,&#8221;and I
emphasised the fact that it was a direct contradiction
to those instructions, as well as to his wishes, and
that it was given in a moment of good-natured weakness;
but I venture to suggest that that weakness,
instead of being contrary to what we know of his
character, was in remarkable accordance with it.</p>

<p>I will admit that I long hesitated to use the word
&#8220;weakness&#8221;in connection with Father Garnet; but
he himself practically owned that he was not always
free from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I acknowledge,&#8221;he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> before his death,
&#8220;that I was bound to reveal all knowledge that I had
of this or any other treason out of the sacrament of
confession. And whereas, partly upon hope of prevention,
partly for that I would not betray my friend, I
did not reveal the general knowledge of Mr Catesby&#8217;s
intention, which I had by him, I do acknowledge
myself highly guilty to have offended God, the King&#8217;s
Majesty and Estate, and humbly ask of all forgiveness,
exhorting all Catholics that they no way follow my
example.&#8221;To Father Greenway, again, he wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>&#8220;Indeed,
I might have revealed a general knowledge
I had of Mr Catesby out of confession, but hoping of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>the Pope&#8217;s prevention, and being loth to hurt my
friend, I acknowledge to have so far forth offended
God and the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>With all humility, I beg to submit that a feeble,
unguarded, nervous and indulgent speech such as that
about the &#8220;stirrs,&#8221;attributed by Sir Everard Digby
to Father Garnet, is not very inconsistent with that
good Father&#8217;s conduct, as described by himself in the
above manuscripts.</p>

<p>The question whether Father Garnet did, or did
not, die a martyr, however interesting, is altogether
apart from my subject; a life of Sir Everard Digby
is in no way affected by that controversy; nor am I
taking upon myself the offices of Devil&#8217;s Advocate in
Garnet&#8217;s case, when I endeavour to do justice to that
of Sir Everard.</p>

<p>I fully admit that <i>if</i> Father Garnet was weak, his
weakness was owing to an excess of kindheartedness
and a loyalty to his friends that bordered on extravagance.
I am well aware that it is easy to be &#8220;wise
after the event,&#8221;and that that sort of wisdom is too
cheap to justify confident or summary sentences on
those whose surroundings in their own times were so
complicated as to make it impossible to put ourselves
exactly in their places. Again, it may be that Sir
Everard misheard or misunderstood Garnet, that his
memory failed him, or even that he lied. Yet,
again, it is possible that Digby&#8217;s letter may have
been incorrectly transcribed, though I can see no<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
reason for thinking this at all likely to be the
case.</p>

<p>There is, however, another side to the question.
The mischief which may be wrought by a holy, amiable,
but weak man, especially one whose dread of giving
pain to others, or putting them into bad faith, or
making them give up all religion by saying more
than they can bear, when it is his duty to speak
plainly, fully, and decidedly, is almost unlimited; and
if we are to hesitate to form opinions of the actions
and characters of those who have lived in the past, for
the reasons given above, we must relinquish historical
studies once and for ever. Lastly, we ought not to
extol one character at the expense of another. Father
Garnet&#8217;s weak speech, if weak it was, to some extent
excuses, or rather somewhat lessens, the guilt of Sir
Everard Digby. We must try to put ourselves in
Digby&#8217;s place as well as in Garnet&#8217;s; nor do I see
that Sir Everard&#8217;s evidence need be discredited. It
was not extorted under examination; on the contrary,
it was deliberately written to his wife, and whatever
his faults may have been, deceit and dishonesty do
not appear to have been among them.</p>

<p>But let me say one word now as to the difficulties in
which Father Garnet was placed. Familiar as we are
with the means through which he came to know of the
plot, I will take the liberty of reminding my readers
of them.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Suspecting that Catesby was scheming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>some mischief, he had taxed him with it, and told him
that, being against the Pope&#8217;s will, it would not prosper.
Catesby had replied that, if the Pope knew what he
intended to do, he would not hinder it. Then Father
Garnet urged him to let the Pope know all about the
whole affair. Catesby said he would not do so for the
world, lest it should be discovered; but he offered to impart
his project to Father Garnet. This Father Garnet
refused to hear. Catesby, with all his double-dealing,
seems to have become filled with remorse and anxiety,
for he revealed the plot to Father Greenway in confession,
giving him leave to reveal it in his turn to Father
Garnet, in the same manner and under the same seal.</p>

<p>It is difficult for Protestants to realise the secresy of
the confessional. Not only can the confessor say nothing
of what he has heard in it to anyone else, but he may
not even speak of it to the penitent himself, unless
the penitent specially requests him to do so, except in
confession; nor can he in any way act towards him,
or concerning him, on the strength of it. On the
other hand, the penitent, although sometimes bound
in honour and honesty not to reveal what the priest
may say to him confidentially, as man to man, is theologically
free to repeat anything that the priest may
have said to him in the confessional to the whole world
if he so wills; he can also, if he pleases, set the priest at
liberty to speak either to himself about it, outside the
confessional, or to any other particular person or persons
whom he may choose to name, or to everybody, if he<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
likes; but, unless so liberated, if the confessor hears
that his penitent is publicly or privately giving a
wrong version of the advice given him in confession,
he cannot set himself right by giving the true one.</p>

<p>Father Greenway, horrified at the disclosure, availed
himself of Catesby&#8217;s permission to confide it to Father
Garnet in confession. The latter<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> &#8220;was amazed,&#8221;and
&#8220;said it was a most horrible thing, the like of which
was never heard of, for many reasons unlawful, &amp;c.,&#8221;
and he proceeded to reprimand Father Greenway very
severely for even giving ear to the matter.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> By this,
Endæmon the Jesuit, who tells the story, probably
means &#8220;for discussing&#8221;the matter, and not refusing
to listen to any defence of it. A priest can hardly be
blamed for &#8220;hearing&#8221;anything in confession; yet
this is what Endæmon says. Therefore it would
appear that, whether Father Garnet acted imprudently
or not, Father Greenway certainly did so&mdash;at any rate,
in Father Garnet&#8217;s opinion.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The position in which Catesby was placed with regard
to the sacraments of confession and communion
is delicate ground for a layman to approach; especially
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>as nobody knows exactly what took place with regard
to either. I am told, however, by those who ought to
know, that this much may be said from my own point
of view, without danger of theological error. Father
Greenway, after telling Catesby in confession about
the nature of the enormity he was meditating, must
have refused him absolution and the sacraments if he
persevered.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> After so striking a sentence, what
possible room is there for thinking that Catesby could
have gone on without even a <i>serious practical doubt</i>
as to the lawfulness of his object? Yet to have
persevered with such a doubt would have put him at
once into a state of <i>mala fides</i>. And if he became in
a state of <i>mala fides</i>, as he was in the habit of going
to the sacraments every week, he must have done one
or other of two things. He must either have made
sacrilegious communions, or he must have given
up going to Holy Communion in order to commit the
crime of proceeding with the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p>There is another point in connection with Catesby&#8217;s
confession which is worthy of notice. When he first
told the other conspirators that he had obtained the
consent of a Jesuit to a case similar to the Gunpowder
Plot, he could at least honestly say that no priest had at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>that time directly <i>condemned</i> the Gunpowder Plot
itself as such; but, when Father Greenway had
distinctly done so, he still seems to have left them
under the impression that the Jesuit Fathers approved
of the conspiracy &#8220;in general, though they knew not
the particulars.&#8221;To do this was to <i>act</i> a lie! But
it seems to have been after he had heard Greenway
condemn the Plot in confession that he said something
of the same kind to Sir Everard Digby for the first
time, and in that case he <i>told</i> a lie! In short, if&mdash;mind,
I say if&mdash;after hearing Greenway&#8217;s denunciation
of the Plot, which, according to Father Pollen,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> was in
July, he gave Sir Everard Digby to understand, on
first telling him of the plot, in the following September,
that the scheme in general had the approval of
the Jesuits, though they knew not the particulars,
when he was well aware that he himself <i>had</i> told them
the main particulars, and was certain that they did
<i>not</i> approve of it, he obtained Sir Everard&#8217;s adherence
to the plot by a direct fraud, and acted the part of an
unscrupulous scoundrel.</p>

<p>Some devout people have endeavoured to find
excuses for Catesby&mdash;not for his action with regard to
the plot, of course, but for the condition of mind into
which he fell preparatory to it&mdash;on the ground that
he was a good Catholic. What is a good Catholic?
I suppose a man who keeps God&#8217;s commandments and
obeys his Church. One commandment is, &#8220;Thou
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>shalt do no murder&#8221;; and one of the Pope&#8217;s orders, in
Catesby&#8217;s time, was that the Catholics in England were
not to rise against the Government. But then it is
said that Catesby went to Holy Communion every
week. Be it so! Another historical character, one
Judas Iscariot, committed a still worse crime immediately
after receiving his First Communion.</p>

<p>Robert Catesby was one of those most dangerous
men to his own cause, a Catholic on Protestant principles.
He acted in direct opposition to the commands
of the Divine Founder of his Church, as well as to the
precepts of the representative of that Divine Founder
upon earth. He preferred his own private opinion
to that of either. He considered his own Decalogue
and Beatitudes juster and more sublime than the
Almighty&#8217;s, his own intentions for the welfare of the
Church wiser than the Holy Father&#8217;s, his own moral
theology more orthodox than that of the Jesuits; and
then this Protestant in practice&mdash;for Protestantism is
not exclusively restricted to protests against such
matters as the supremacy of the Pope or transubstantiation&mdash;took
it upon himself to pose as a prominent
champion of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>I am not denying that Catesby fancied he was
doing right; but whether that fancy was arrived at
by right means or wrong is another question. He
seems to have argued to himself that Pope, Priests,
and Jesuits were not equal to the occasion; that there
were times, of which his own was one, at which papal,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>
spiritual, and even biblical teaching must for the
moment be set on one side whilst the secular arm
struck a violent blow for the relief of God&#8217;s suffering
people; that, <i>ante factum</i>, the ecclesiastical powers
could not consent to such a measure, but that, <i>post
factum</i>, they would not only tolerate it, but approve
of and rejoice at it. It came, therefore, to this, that
on a most important point of morals&mdash;faith and morals,
be it remembered, are the two chief provinces over
which the Catholic Church claims power&mdash;a private
individual, and not the Church, was to decide what
was best; in short, Catesby was to protest against the
teaching of the Church. Luther protested in matters
of faith; Catesby protested in matters of morals.
Both men seem to have believed that the time would
come when the Church would see that what they did
was for its welfare.</p>

<p>It has been said that in Father Garnet we have one
of the most remarkable instances in history of the
secresy of the confessional. On this point I venture no
opinion; but I am bold enough to say that in Robert
Catesby we have one of the most remarkable instances
in history of the abuse of the confessional. Perhaps no
man ever did more to foster that superstitious horror of
&#8220;auricular confession&#8221;which has so long prevailed,
and still prevails in this country.</p>

<p>In passing, I may meet a possible inquiry as to how
it came about that so much should be known concerning
what Catesby had told Greenway in confession, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>
what Greenway had told Garnet under the same sacred
seal. The explanation is simple. Catesby had not
only given Father Greenway permission to inform
Father Garnet of the plot, under seal of confession,
but had<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> &#8220;arranged that neither should be bound by
that seal when lawfully examined by their superiors.&#8221;
Another question naturally presents itself, much more
connected with the man whose life I am writing, which
I confess I do not find it so easy to answer. It is the
following:&mdash;When Father Garnet noticed the sudden
and suspicious confidences which had arisen between
Catesby and Sir Everard Digby,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> after their ride from
Harrowden to Gothurst, did he, though tongue-tied as
to what he knew of Catesby&#8217;s designs under seal of
confession, know enough <i>out</i> of the confessional to
warn Sir Everard against consenting to, or joining in,
any illicit schemes which Catesby might propose to him
and had he an extra-confessional <i>causa loquendi</i>?</p>

<p>Let us suppose that he asked himself this question.
Even if he answered it in the affirmative, he might have
refrained from acting, through fear that, in his
vehemence in warning Sir Everard, there might be
a danger of his breaking the seal of the confessional;
or that in vaguely putting Sir Everard on his guard,
he might raise the suspicion that knowledge obtained
in the confessional was the occasion, or the impelling
cause of that warning. Or he might reflect that, if
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>cross-questioned by Sir Everard, it would be difficult
to remember, at a moment&#8217;s notice, exactly how much
of his knowledge of Catesby&#8217;s schemes was sealed by
confession, and how much unsealed.</p>

<p>Yet when he looked at his young host, and at his
charming and excellent wife, still a mere girl, but with
two little children beside her, in their beautiful and
happy home, the model of what a Christian home
ought to be, and a centre of Catholic society; and
when he considered that hitherto Sir Everard Digby
had been as upright in character as in stature, and
as distinguished in virtue as in appearance, might he
not have told himself that any effort was worth making
to try to save him from a terrible crime and its terrible
consequences?</p>

<p>He was the only man who could do so! He alone
had &#8220;a general knowledge of Mr Catesby&#8217;s intention,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
untrammelled by the secresy of either oath or
confessional, and he<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> &#8220;noticed the new intimacy that
had sprung up between Catesby and Digby,&#8221;and surmised
truly enough that Digby had been &#8220;drawn in.&#8221;
Yet it is evident from Sir Everard&#8217;s letters from the
Tower, that Father Garnet never lifted a finger nor
uttered a word to hinder his host from joining, or
proceeding in, the conspiracy which was to work his
ruin. This is the more remarkable because Father
Garnet might have been expected not only to wish to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>save Sir Everard from the guilt and the dangers of the
Plot, but also to prevent a conspiracy which he so much
dreaded from being strengthened by the support of
a man of considerable wealth. The most probable
origin of his inaction in this matter was the same
weakness of character which had exhibited itself in his
speech to Sir Everard about the Pope and the &#8220;stirrs,&#8221;
and in his failure to reveal his &#8220;general knowledge, had
of Mr Catesby out of confession,&#8221;whereby he said he
offended God and the King. His silence and inaction
were certainly not owing to any temporary revival of
confidence in his mind. On the contrary, he
wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> &#8220;I remained in the greatest perplexity
that ever I was in my life, and could not sleep a&#8217;
nights.&#8221;He added, &#8220;I did offer up all my devotions
and masses that God of his mercy and infinite
Providence would dispose of all for the best, and find
means which were pleasing unto Him, to prevent so
great a mischief&#8221;[as the Gunpowder Plot]. &#8220;I
knew that this would be infinitely displeasing to my
Superiors in Rome, in so much as at my second conference
with Mr Greenway, I said, &#8216;Good Lord, if this
matter go forward, the Pope will send me to the
galleys, for he will assuredly think I was privy
to it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Far be it from me to presume to judge Father
Garnet harshly; his opportunities may have been
much less, his difficulties may have been much
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>greater, than the evidence before us would seem to
show; but, as a biographer of Sir Everard Digby, I
feel bound to express my regret that it should appear
as if Father Garnet might have saved him from
the terrible troubles that followed and failed to
do so.</p>

<p>I began this chapter with a reference to those who
plead extenuating circumstances for Catesby. Let me
end it by referring to somewhat similar-minded critics,
who, while they condemn the Gunpowder Plot as a
most dastardly outrage, regard it as the hot-blooded
attempt of a small party of Catholics driven to
desperation by their sufferings. Of the sufferings of
the English Catholics there can be no sort of doubt or
question; and none the less certain is it that, as a body,
they bore them with patience and without any attempt
at rebellion. Was, then, the small party of Catholics
that conspired in the Gunpowder Plot composed of
men so exceptionally exposed to sufferings for their
faith as to be, more than any of their fellow-sufferers,
&#8220;driven to desperation&#8221;? It is well worth while to
inquire. We will consult a Catholic contemporary,
most unlikely to represent their lot as too easy, namely,
the oft-quoted Father Gerard.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Let us begin with Catesby, the originator and leader
of the enterprise. The losses of his father on account
of his religion do not concern the objects of the plot,
as they were incurred long before and during a different
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>reign. Catesby himself had certainly lost money, and
a great deal of money; but how?<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> &#8220;He spent much
above his rate [income], and so wasted also good part
of his living.&#8221;He was guilty of &#8220;excess of play and
apparel.&#8221;He also had to pay &#8220;£3000 before he got
out&#8221;of prison, where he had been put for joining in
the ill-fated rising of Essex. Even after all these
losses, he was able to live among men of wealth,
if not in his own country-house at Lapworth, in
Warwickshire.</p>

<p>Ambrose Rokeby was<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> &#8220;a gentleman of good worth
in the county of Suffolk, and of a very ancient family,
and himself the heir of the eldest house.&#8221;At the time
of the plot he had a great many horses, and was
evidently a rich man. John Grant was<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> &#8220;a man of
sufficient estate.&#8221;Francis Tresham was<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> &#8220;a gentleman
of Northamptonshire of great estate, esteemed
then worth £3000 a year,&#8221;a sum, of course, equivalent
to a very large income in these days.
Robert Winter was<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> &#8220;a gentleman of good estate
in Worcestershire.&#8221;Thomas Percy,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> although not
a rich landowner, held the lucrative post of agent
and administrator to his cousin, the Earl of Northumberland.
The &#8220;means were not great&#8221;of Robert
Keyes, John and Christopher Wright, and Thomas
Winter; but most of them seem to have been able
to live in good society, and their want of money
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>was for the most part owing to their being younger
sons, being &#8220;very wild,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> or living &#8220;in good sort
and of the best,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> when their circumstances did not
justify their doing so. As for Sir Everard Digby,
it is scarcely necessary to repeat that he had been
a rich man to begin with, and had increased his
wealth by marrying an heiress. These, then, are
the men who, we are told, were driven to desperation
by their sufferings, and conspired together to
commit a most horrible and murderous crime, while
thousands of Catholics who were literally ruined, by
fines for their religion which they were unable to
pay, bore their troubles in silence, and with Christian
fortitude and resignation.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter, there is one more
point to be considered. The sudden and unpremeditated
assault of a man in despair is sometimes
to be excused, and often to be regarded with
comparative lenience. What looks like murder at
first sight, at second may prove to be only man-slaughter,
under such circumstances. Does any such
excuse exist for the Gunpowder Plot? Was it a
violent attempt made on the spur of the moment,
or was it the result of lengthy, deliberate, and
anxious forethought? Was it the work of an hour,
a day, a week, or even a month. On the contrary,
so far as can be ascertained, at least a year and
a quarter, and more probably a year and a half,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>of careful scheming and calculation were devoted
to it.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>It has been said, in excuse for the conspirators,
that there are reasons for suspecting the idea of the
Gunpowder Plot to have been conceived in the first
instance by Cecil, who had it suggested to Catesby,
through a third person&mdash;possibly Mounteagle&mdash;with
the deliberate intention of bringing discredit upon
the English Catholics, and thereby giving cause for
the enactment of severer measures for their repression.
This may remind some of my readers that, at the
height of the agrarian crime in Ireland, during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century, many good
Irish Catholics were persuaded, or persuaded themselves,
that the outrages were invented, instigated,
and encouraged, if not actually perpetrated, at the
suggestion of the authorities at Dublin Castle, in
order to throw discredit upon &#8220;the poor, oppressed
Irish peasantry,&#8221;and to give an excuse for &#8220;persecuting&#8221;
them with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>As to the question whether Cecil originated the
Gunpowder Plot as a bait with which to entrap
Catholic priests, Jesuits, and laymen, if there be any
grounds for it, it certainly has great historic interests;
but whether Cecil, or the Devil, or both, put the
idea into the heads of the conspirators, little, if at
all, affects their guilt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the last chapter, I showed that
the conspirators were for the most part in fairly
comfortable circumstances, and that some of them
were rich. It was not necessary to my purpose
to enter into details concerning Guy Fawkes, who
was an adventurer and a mere tool, or concerning
Thomas Bates, who was Catesby&#8217;s servant. Nor did
I mention the Littletons&mdash;one a wealthy man, and
the other a younger son, and a cousin of the former;
for, although they joined in the rising after the
discovery of the plot, and suffered death for it, they
do not appear to have been among the sworn conspirators
beforehand. But, before dismissing the
subject of the riches or poverty of the plotters, I
have something more to say.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was chiefly enlisted by Catesby
on account of his wealth. He promised to contribute
£1500 towards the scheme, and to furnish, in addition,
as much armour and as many arms, men, and horses
as he might be able. Another large landowner was
enlisted even later than Sir Everard, and for the
same purpose. This was Catesby&#8217;s cousin, Francis<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
Tresham, of Rushton, in Northamptonshire. He, like
Catesby and Percy, had been implicated in the rebellion
of the Earl of Essex, so a plot was no novelty
to him, and he consented to help the new one with
money to the extent of £2000. Funds, again, were
to be found in another quarter.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> &#8220;Mr Percy himself
promised all he could get out of the Earl of
Northumberland&#8217;s rents,&#8221;&mdash;in other language, he
promised to embezzle, and apparently with the pious
Catesby&#8217;s full consent, every penny he was able of
his master&#8217;s money&mdash;&#8220;which was about £4000.&#8221;
Here, therefore, we have a fund of £7500, to say
nothing of what Catesby and the other conspirators
may have spent in the early stages of the plot.</p>

<p>In the reign of James I., a sovereign sterling was
worth very much more than it is at present; some
people say ten times as much;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> so if they are right,
the Gunpowder Plot Fund amounted to £75,000 of
our money.</p>

<p>What became of it? All the work done was
voluntary and unpaid. The hiring of the cellar
under the houses of Parliament could not have been
a very heavy outlay; very many hundreds of pounds
cannot have been spent in gunpowder; and if a good
deal may have been invested in horses, that would
only exhaust a comparatively small portion of so
large a fund. Most likely the conspirators defrayed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>their own personal expenses while working for the
plot, and even if they charged them to the fund, the
men were so few in numbers that they cannot have
amounted to much. Can it be that some immense
bribe was given, or promised, to Guy Fawkes for
the excessively dangerous part which he was to play
in the drama? This is far from unlikely!</p>

<p>The fugitives, after the discovery of the plot,
carried a good deal of cash with them as they rode
about, trying to raise an insurrection. Sir Everard
Digby alone took<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> &#8220;above £1000 in ready coin&#8221;
with him. According to the authority quoted, this
would be the equivalent of £10,000 nowadays, a
large amount to carry about the country. Yet, as
will be seen when the proper time comes, he
apparently made no use of it. The financial aspects
of the Gunpowder Plot are as curious as they are
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>After giving his solemn promise not to divulge
the conspiracy, Sir Everard evidently could say
nothing about it to Lady Digby. It must have
been a terrible trial to have the burden of that
awful secret, with all its dangers to himself and
those dear to him, on his mind when he looked
upon his innocent, holy, and loving young wife,
with her little boy, Kenelm, now two years old,
toddling after her, and her baby, which had been
born early in that year, in her arms, as she walked
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>about the long, low rooms and corridors of Gothurst,
or wandered about its sloping gardens and along the
banks of the River Ouse. While the worst fear in
her mind as she did so would be a visit from pursuivants,
her husband knew of far more terrible
dangers by which their hitherto happy home was
threatened.</p>

<p>Already he was beginning to take precautions
against possible failure and its fearful consequences.
Of course, at Gothurst, as at every other house frequented
by priests, there was a &#8220;priests&#8217; hole&#8221;; but
Sir Everard now ordered preparations for concealment
to be made upon a much more elaborate scale. It is
nearly certain that the most celebrated of all artificers
in priests&#8217; hiding-places was staying at Gothurst just
at this very time. His real name was Nicholas Owen,
but he usually went by the name of &#8220;Little John.&#8221;
He was a Jesuit lay-brother, and he usually accompanied
Father Garnet in his travels. It is recorded
that he went to Gothurst with Father Garnet on his
way to Holywell, and it may be assumed that he was
with him when he returned. Nothing, therefore,
would be simpler or easier for Sir Everard than, on
the plea of a desire to increase his precautions for
priests in case of a raid from pursuivants, to ask Little
John to superintend the making of intricate places of
concealment which should serve as refuges for himself
and his fellow-conspirators in case of discovery, failure,
or pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>He could not have found a better workman for this
purpose. Father Gerard writes of him:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> &#8220;He it
was that made our hiding-places; in fact he made the
one to which I owed my safety.&#8221;As he probably
made the very curious hiding-places in Sir Everard
Digby&#8217;s house, I may claim to say something about
him. Brother Foley calls him<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> &#8220;that useful, cunning
joiner of those times,&#8221;who &#8220;died a martyr for the
faith, suspended from a Topcliff rack in the Tower of
London, where he was divers times hung up for several
hours together, to compel him to betray the hiding-places
he had made, up and down the land; but not a
word could they force from his sealed and faithful lips.&#8221;
&#8220;The authorities, shocked at their own cruelty, gave
out that he destroyed himself.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> A Protestant writer
accordingly calls him<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> &#8220;that Owen who ript out his
own bowells in the Tower.&#8221;Father Gerard denies
this story at great length,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> stating that the poor man
suffered from hernia, and that although &#8220;the civil law
doth forbid to torture any man that is broken,&#8221;the
executioners &#8220;girded&#8221;the afflicted part &#8220;with a plate
of iron to keep in&#8221;the portion which threatened to
protrude, but that &#8220;the extremity of pain (which is
most in that kind of torment), about the breast&#8221;and
the seat of the hernia, &#8220;did force out&#8221;the interior,
&#8220;and so the iron did serve but to cut and wound his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>body, which, perhaps, did afterwards put them in
mind to give out that he had ripped his&#8221;part in
question, &#8220;with a knife. Which, besides all the
former reasons, is in itself improbable, if not impossible.
For first, in that case, knives are not allowed
but only in the time of meat, whilst one stands by,
and those such as are broad at the point, and will
only cut towards the midst.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to his skill in making hiding-places, a Jesuit,
Father Tanner, wrote of him that<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> &#8220;With incomparable
skill he knew how to conduct priests to a
place of safety along subterranean passages, to hide
them between walls, to bury them in impenetrable
recesses, and to entangle them in labyrinths and
a thousand windings. But what was much more
difficult of accomplishment, he so disguised the
entrances to these as to make them most unlike
what they really were.&#8221;&#8220;When he was about
to design&#8221;a hiding-place, he commenced the work
by &#8220;receiving the Most Holy Eucharist, sought to
aid its progress by continual prayer, and offered the
completion of it to God alone, accepting of no other
reward for his toil than the merit of charity and the
consolation of labouring for the good of Catholics.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I have shown, it may pretty safely be assumed
that he was at Gothurst early in October 1605, just
after Sir Everard Digby had been initiated into the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>plot; and, as the hiding-places at Gothurst about
to be described are believed to have been made
between his initiation and the discovery, with a
view to concealment in connection with the gunpowder
plot, the work must in that case have been
done during October.</p>

<i>The mark * shows the position of the secret room</i></p>

<p>Lipscomb thus describes them:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> &#8220;In one of the
apartments was formerly shewn a movable floor,
which, to ordinary observers, offered nothing remarkable
in its appearance, but was made to revolve on
a pivot, which, by a secret bolt, disclosed underneath
it another room (receiving light from the lower part
of a mullioned window, not discoverable exteriorily,
unless at a very great distance).&#8221;From this secret
room, he says &#8220;there were private passages of ingress
and egress,&#8221;&#8220;almost impossible of detection, even
by the occupiers of the Mansion. Here were also
some remarkably ingenious cabinets and drawers,
for the deposit of papers, &amp;c.&#8221;Mr Walter Carlile,
the son of the owner, and the occupier of Gothurst,
or Gayhurst, as it is now called, informs me that
Lipscomb&#8217;s description of the secret room is perfectly
correct; that, although it was demolished twenty
years ago, greatly to his own regret, there are still
all the traces of where it was and how it was
managed; and that the &#8220;priest&#8217;s hole&#8221;and some
secret passages are yet in existence.</p>

<p>The secret room was not in the principal front,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>with its picturesque porch and gables; but at the
end, at the right; that is to say, on the right as one
stood facing the front. In the middle of this end
of the house was a solid, square-headed projection,
and it was the upper half of the room on the first
floor of this projection which was converted into the
secret room. The result was that, in this secret
chamber the window came down to the floor, but
did not rise to the top of the room, being in fact
the upper half of the window which lighted the
room beneath it. As the entire window was almost
twice as high as it was broad, and divided into
two equal parts, it was very well adapted for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Lipscomb was probably right in calling this &#8220;a
very artful contrivance for the concealment of the
parties to the Gunpowder Plot&#8221;; there is certainly
a tradition to the same effect, and, as will have been
observed, I have adopted it; at the same time I will
say candidly that I sometimes ask myself whether,
after all, the &#8220;contrivance,&#8221;with its pivotted floor,
may not have been only intended as a hiding-place
for priests, and not for conspirators, a theory which
is somewhat supported by the knowledge that Sir
Everard Digby was going to leave and shut up
Gothurst a few days before the explosion was to
take place, and even still earlier was going to send
his wife and children to Mr Throgmorton&#8217;s house at
Coughton, which he had taken for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>The energies of the conspirators, especially those
of such an earnest Catholic as Sir Everard Digby,
would be stimulated during October by the news that,
that very month, two priests and a layman had been
put to death for their religion.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> &#8220;They were executed
together with sixteen thieves and eight other
malefactors; and their heads were placed on London
Bridge.&#8221;A Spanish lady of high birth, who had
come to England in the preceding May, wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> &#8220;We
can hardly go out to walk without seeing the
heads and limbs of some of our dear and holy ones
stuck up on the gates that divide the streets, and the
birds of the air perching upon them; which makes me
think of the verse in the Psalms, &#8216;They have given
the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the
fowls of the air,&#8217;&#8221;etc. Admitting that there may
have been some exaggeration in this statement, it
was by no means devoid of foundation in fact. The
reports of such things would give the conspiracy the
colour of a crusade, to men anxious to see it assume
that hue.</p>

<p>We shall presently see that Sir Everard intended
to turn his steps towards Wales, when the blow
should have been struck, making sure of the support
of Catholics so persecuted as the Welsh and the
inhabitants of the border counties. Here is something
about them. Less than five months before
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>the attempt to blow up the houses of parliament,
the Protestant Bishop of Hereford wrote to Salisbury:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> &#8220;On
Wednesday last, at evening, Sir James
Scudamore and other justices of the peace, with
such aid as I could give them, went unto the Darren
and other places adjoining to make search and
apprehend Jesuits and priests ... and did make
diligent search all that night and day following,
from village to village, from house to house, about
thirty miles compass, near the confines of Monmouthshire,
where they found altars, images, books of
superstition, relics of idolatry, but left all desolate
of men and women. Except here and there an aged
woman or a child, all were fled into Wales, and but
one man apprehended; all that circuit of rude
barbarous people carried headlong into these desperate
courses by priests (whereof there is great store) and
principal gentlemen, lords of towns and manors there.
They are all fled into the woods, and there they will
lurk until the assizes be past.&#8221;Rumours of the
searches on the part of the &#8220;justices of the peace,&#8221;
&#8220;with such aid&#8221;as the Bishop of Hereford &#8220;could
give them,&#8221;would reach Gothurst and provoke Sir
Everard. They remind one of the remark made by
Cardinal Bellarmine on the Gunpowder Plot:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> &#8220;I
excuse not the crime, I loathe unnatural murders,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>I execrate conspiracies, but no one can deny that
provocation was given.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan of campaign was doubtless discussed at
great length at Gothurst during the early part of
the month of October. Parliament was to meet at
the beginning of November, and the great attempt
was intended to be made about the 5th. No time,
therefore, was to be lost in making provision for
every contingency. Sir Everard was still anxious
as to whether all the Catholic peers, and those peers
who were friendly to Catholics, could, with any
certainty, be induced to absent themselves from the
House at the time of the explosion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assure yourself,&#8221;said Catesby to him, &#8220;that
such of the nobility as are worth saving shall be
preserved, and yet know not of the matter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> As
to the remainder of the lords, he declared that he
regarded them as &#8220;atheists, fools, and cowards, and
that lusty bodies would be better for the commonwealth
than they.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> There was considerable wrangling
as to which of the peers were to be saved, and
there was some diversity of opinion on the question&mdash;whether
this or that Protestant lord was well-enough
disposed towards Catholics and their religion
to be worth rescue. For instance, some would have
it that the Earl of Northumberland was likely to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>become a Catholic; but his relative, Percy the conspirator,
said that<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> &#8220;for matters of relligion&#8221;he
&#8220;trobled not much himselfe.&#8221;Notwithstanding
this statement, Percy earnestly begged that he might
be one of the peers to be spared,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> which was indeed
only fair, considering that his rents were to be stolen
for the purposes of the plot. Francis Tresham
pleaded for his two brothers-in-law, Stourton and
Mounteagle, both of whom were Catholics; Keyes
for his great friend, Mordaunt; Fawkes for Montague,
several for Arundel, and so on.</p>

<p>As to the plan of proceedings, when the explosion
should have taken place with success, the great
principle was to be to rally the Catholic gentry with
their servants and retainers for a general rising in
a central district. Gothurst was considered too far
east for this purpose, and Warwickshire was selected
as the base of operations for the volunteer Catholic
army. It was true that that army did not yet
exist; that the number of men at present initiated
into the conspiracy was very small; and that the
spirit in which the Catholics would receive the news
of the wholesale massacre of the King and his Parliament
remained to be proved; but Catesby and his
confederates, Sir Everard apparently among the
number, were very sanguine.</p>

<p>Catesby, the originator, organiser, and leader of
the whole proceeding, was to have the management
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>of the grand explosion and the conduct of matters
in London immediately afterwards, while Digby was
to have the charge of the rising in Warwickshire,
where Catesby was to join him, as occasion might
serve. As a nucleus of his hoped-for army, Sir
Everard was to take so many of his retainers as
he could muster, with a quantity of arms in carts,
to Dunchurch, a place very near Rugby, and to invite
a large number of his trustworthy friends, likely to
join in the cause, to come there with their horses and
servants for a great &#8220;hunting-match&#8221;on Dunsmoor
Heath.</p>

<p>Country gentlemen in our own times have often
wondered what this &#8220;hunting-match&#8221;could be.
Possibly it may have been a coursing meeting. The
foundation of the rules of coursing, in its modern
sense, was the code drawn up by the Duke of
Norfolk in the reign of Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and as Sir
Everard had been a good deal at the Court of that
Queen, and was devoted to field sports, it is not
unreasonable to infer that the so-called &#8220;hunting-match&#8221;
may have been ostensibly what we should
call a coursing-meeting, with, perhaps, some hawking
added. It was arranged that on the arrival of
the guests invited to take part in it at Dunchurch,
Sir Everard was to hint to them that a decisive
blow of some sort was about to be struck in London,
although they were not to be enlightened as to its
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>nature until the news should arrive of its success.
On the receipt of this news, Digby was at once to
despatch a party to seize the Princess Elizabeth at
the house of her governor, Lord Harington&mdash;he
had been created Baron Harington of Exton in 1603&mdash;at
his house near Coventry, and if Catesby should
fail to secure the persons of the Prince of Wales or
the Duke of York in the South, Digby was to proclaim
her Queen. The little volunteer army in
Warwickshire was then to seize the horses at
Warwick Castle and the store of armour at Whewell
Grange, Lord Windsor&#8217;s house in Worcestershire, &#8220;and
by that time,&#8221;said Catesby, in unfolding his plan,
&#8220;I hope some friends will come and take our parts.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Sir Everard was not going to leave his wife and
children at Gothurst, between the great rallying centre
of his expected army in Warwickshire and the possible
opposing army which, in case of failure, might approach
from London. On the contrary, he was anxious to
place them on the further side of Warwickshire, so
that the band of Catholic warriors might lie between
them and the source of danger; at the same time
he wished to have them within easy reach; and,
for this purpose, he hired or borrowed from Mr
Throckmorton, a house called Coughton (containing
many &#8220;secret recesses&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>), near Alcester, and about
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>twenty-five miles from the primary rallying point
at Dunchurch.</p>

<p>Sir Everard said in his examination in Nov. 1605,
that he &#8220;did borrow a howse of Mr Thomas Throckmorton
for one moneth, purposing to take it longer, or
to enquire out some other if that were not to be had,
if&#8221;his &#8220;wife should like to live there.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Being, in those days, a quadrangular house,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> it could
easily be defended in case of need. It is impossible
that Sir Everard can have given Lady Digby the real
reason for which he proposed to remove her there: the
secret which he was keeping from her can scarcely have
failed to cause some restraint between them, and it
would be but natural that she should feel considerable
uneasiness. Why, she would ask herself, should her
husband, who had hitherto shared everything with her,
now have something in hand which he was evidently
concealing?</p>

<p>Another inmate at Gothurst was in a state of great
anxiety, namely Father Garnet. The exertions to
which his lay companion, &#8220;Little John,&#8221;was put, at
his host&#8217;s request, to increase the secret passages and
make a hidden room, may have aroused his suspicions
still further; but, after all, Gothurst would be no more
ramified with such places of concealment than certain
other houses; for instance, at Hendlip Hall, about four
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>miles from Worcester, a house to which Father Garnet
was to go within two months, to spend several weeks,
a house, moreover, of much the same date as Gothurst,
there was<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> &#8220;scarcely an apartment that&#8221;had &#8220;not
secret ways of going in or going out&#8221;; some had &#8220;back
stair cases concealed in the walls; others&#8221;&#8220;places of
retreat in their chimneys; some&#8221;&#8220;trap-doors, and all&#8221;
presented &#8220;a picture of gloom, insecurity, and suspicion.&#8221;
And well might the inmates of a Catholic family
live in &#8220;gloom, insecurity, and suspicion,&#8221;in those
days of pursuivants, fines, hangings, and quarterings.</p>

<p>Father Gerard, who was a frequent visitor at
Gothurst, observed with surprise that Sir Everard
had a far larger number of horses than he had been
accustomed to keep;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> but, when it occurred to him
that this might be because he was, for some reason
or other, better off than before, he found that, on the
contrary, he had been selling his farm-stock, and
even some land, which puzzled him much, particularly
in so prudent and careful a man, and the more so
since he was aware that Sir Everard was going to
pay the fine required of recusants by the statute, and
was therefore in no danger of having his stock taken
from him compulsorily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>Although Sir Everard Digby had been led by
Catesby to believe that some of the Jesuit Fathers
had given their approval to the Gunpowder Plot,
and had special reasons, as we have seen, for imagining
Father Garnet to be one of these, he does not
appear to have thought that Father Gerard knew
anything about the matter, or would have consented
to it if he had known of it: for, on his arraignment,
he declared that Father Gerard was ignorant of it,
and that he had never mentioned it to him, <a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>&#8220;alleging
the reason,&#8221;&#8220;because, he said, he feared lest&#8221;
that Father &#8220;should dissuade him from it.&#8221;So here
we find him acting in opposition to his greatest
friend&mdash;his &#8220;brother,&#8221;as he called him&mdash;the priest
who had received him into the Church, and was
his chief spiritual adviser. A good Catholic might
lawfully act in opposition to the opinion of his
confessor or director in matters open to difference
of view, especially when that opinion was only
suspected, and had not been delivered; but on such
an all-important question as this, he might have been
expected to consult Gerard, although it must be remembered
that he had been assured by Catesby that
another Jesuit had approved of the plot.</p>

<p>There is one consideration on this subject which is
of the highest importance, namely, that Garnet was the
Provincial, that is to say the superior and the very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>highest authority among the Jesuits in England, at
that time, and therefore the Jesuit of all others most
in communication with Rome, and most likely to know
the mind of the General of his Order as well as that of
the Holy Father himself.</p>

<p>During October, not only Catesby, but other conspirators
visited Gothurst. Among these was Fawkes,
the adventurer who was intended to be actual perpetrator
of the terrible deed. He was not altogether
ill-born, being a member of an at least respectable
family in Yorkshire, his father having been Registrar
and Advocate of the Consistory Court of York Minster.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
He was thirty-five years old, and he had seen much of
the world, having entered the Spanish army in Flanders
and been at the taking of Calais by the Archduke
Albert in 1596.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> He was a man, too, who made some
profession of devotion as a Catholic.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Father Greenway
describes him as<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> &#8220;a man of great piety, of exemplary
temperance, of mild and cheerful demeanour, an enemy
of broils and disputes, a faithful friend, and remarkable
for his punctual attendance upon religious observances.&#8221;
He had been to Spain, on the private embassy to Philip
II. with Christopher Wright, and he had a brother
then a barrister in one of the Inns of Court in London.
Therefore he was not ill-fitted by his antecedents to
be received as a guest at Gothurst, shrink as we may
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>from the idea of such a man being admitted to the
house of the gentle Lady Digby.</p>

<p>This intending actor in a very dark deed arrived in
dull, stormy, and gloomy weather. Much rain had
fallen, and the dead leaves lay wet and dank about the
gables and recesses of Gothurst. There were, then,
none of the modern arrangements of hot-water pipes,
or other contrivances for keeping out the cold in a large
stone house, of which luxurious people avail themselves
so freely in these days, and the long rooms must have
felt chilly, on the October nights, beyond a certain radius
from the piles of burning logs in the large open grates.</p>

<p>People talking secrets do not find the family or
social circle round the fire a very convenient place in
which to interchange their confidences, and Sir Everard
Digby and Guy Fawkes had good reason one evening,
when supper was ended, for withdrawing to a dark and
distant corner to discuss the terrible scheme in which
both were so deeply engrossed; neither Sir Everard&#8217;s
wife nor his chaplain, nor Father Garnet, nor either of
the ladies who were staying in the house, could be
permitted to hear a word of their whisperings about
the details and prospects of the fatal plot; so the two
conspirators were obliged to forego the warmth of
the cheerful fire until their conversation should be
ended.</p>

<p>A damp chill, in spite of the flickering light from
the burning wood, seems to have suggested to the host
the probable condition of a certain fireless cellar in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
Westminster; for he muttered in a low tone to his
guest<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> &#8220;that he was much afraid that the Powder in
the cellar was grown dank, and that some new must be
provided, lest that should not take fire,&#8221;words which
show that, having once yielded to the temptations of
Catesby, the ill-fated youth had thrown himself heart
and soul into the diabolical conspiracy. The biographer
of Sir Everard Digby may well wish that he had never
been guilty of any such speech.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>Both Catesby and Fawkes left Gothurst as October
wore on; so also did any other conspirators who may
have visited it. Most of them betook themselves to
White Webbs, a desolate, half-timbered house, with
&#8220;many trap-doors and passages,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> on Enfield Chase,
to the north of London, about ten miles from the
cellar where their gunpowder lay.</p>

<p>This house had been taken, a long time before this,
by Anne Vaux, and was rented by her<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> as a convenient
place near London for the meeting of priests and the
Catholic laity. Unfortunately, it had gradually got
more into the hands of her relatives, who found it useful
for other purposes. These relatives were Catesby
and Tresham.</p>

<p>At one time White Webbs had been inhabited
almost exclusively by Jesuits, being used as a centre
for the renovation of vows, religious retreats, and
conferences upon the affairs of their missions.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> In his
examination,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Father Garnet said &#8220;that it was a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>spacious house fitt to receave so great a company that
should resort to him thither; there being two bedds
placed in a chamber, but thinketh there have not
been above the number of 14 Jesuits at one time
there.&#8221;Disastrously for himself and his order, he
was obliged to confess<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> that &#8220;Catesby and Wynter,
or Mr Catesby alone, came to him to White Webbs
and tould this exam<sup>t</sup>. there was a plott in hand
for the Cath<sup>c</sup>. cause against the King and the State,&#8221;
assuring him that it was something quite &#8220;lawfull&#8221;;
but that he had &#8220;dissuaded him,&#8221;and that &#8220;he
promised to surceasse.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no secret that White Webbs had been one
of the principal meeting-places of the Jesuits; therefore,
after they had given up going there, and it had
got into the hands of Catesby and his band of conspirators,
the Government, not altogether unnaturally,
supposed that the Jesuits had purposely assigned it to
the plotters as a convenient place from which to carry
out their dread design.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the case; for, in October
1605, Father Garnet had intended to have gone
thither, but finding that Catesby and his friends had
established themselves in the house, most likely with
the purpose of carrying out the &#8220;plott in hand,&#8221;
which he so greatly feared, he did not dare to go
there,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> &#8220;and so accepted the offer of Sir Everard to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>be his tenants at Coughton.&#8221;He felt the more anxious
to go to Coughton because Catesby had promised to
come there on the 31st;<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and he says, &#8220;I assuredly,
if they had come, had entered into the matter, and
perhaps might have hindered all.&#8221;As the modern
Jesuit, Father Pollen, says, &#8220;to be able to do this he
would, of course, have to ask Catesby to allow him to
open the matter, but of success in this, considering
that Catesby had of his own accord offered to tell him,
he did not much doubt, and, perhaps to make the
negotiations easier, he had ordered Greenway to be
there too.&#8221;The pity is that he had not &#8220;entered into
the matter&#8221;earlier. Nervous and horror-stricken, he
had refused to allow Catesby to tell him the details,
when he had reason for believing a plot to be brewing;
he was tongue-tied when he afterwards met Catesby,
having heard those details in confession; yet, after
being for some time at Gothurst with Catesby, it was
not until Catesby had left that he came to the
conclusion that he might, and that it was highly
desirable that he should, beg Catesby&#8217;s leave to speak
to him of a subject which had been transmitted
to him through the confessional, at Catesby&#8217;s desire.</p>

<p>A zealous Catholic like Sir Everard would be comforted
by learning that an envoy had been privately
despatched to Rome, to explain everything to the Pope,
from the point of view of the conspirators, as soon as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>the great event should have taken place. The person
selected for this purpose was Sir Edward Baynham, a
member of a good Gloucestershire family, and an intimate
friend of Catesby&#8217;s. He had started in September.
Unluckily for himself, Father Garnet, on hearing that
Baynham was going to Rome, as Catesby&#8217;s messenger,
had encouraged it, believing,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> &#8220;that he had procured
Baynham&#8217;s mission in order to inform the Pope generally
of the Plot, and that this was the reason why he
so confidently expected from his Holiness a prohibition
of the whole business.&#8221;Father Garnet&#8217;s approval of
Baynham&#8217;s mission was thus capable of quotation, or
rather misquotation, to Sir Everard Digby, and would
naturally confirm the reports of his full approval of
the conspiracy, as previously cited by Catesby.</p>

<p>This mission of Baynham to Rome was destined to
bring trouble upon the conspirators, Sir Everard among
them. In the indictment afterwards made against
them, was the following Count.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> &#8220;That after the
destruction of the King, the Queen, the Prince, and
the Royal Issue Male, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
the Knights and Burgesses; they should notifie the
same to Foreign States; and therefore Sir <i>Edmund
Bayham</i>, an attainted person of Treason, and stiling
himself prince of the damned crew, should be sent, and
make the same known to the Pope, and crave his aid;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>an Ambassador fit, both for the message and
persons, to be sent betwixt the Pope and the
Devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last week of October must have been a time
of great anxiety to Sir Everard. His companions at
Gothurst appear to have been his wife and his two
little children, Mrs Vaux, her sister-in-law, Anne
Vaux, and Father Garnet. In the meantime he was
making his preparations for the pretended coursing-meeting
at Dunchurch. He was arranging how the
arms, armour, and ammunition were to be conveyed
in carts, covered over with other things to conceal
them, and he was getting his men and horses ready
for the start. He was also making preparations for
the journey of his wife, children, and guests to
Coughton, and for this party, alone, a good many
servants and horses were required.</p>

<p>It is highly improbable that Catesby and the other
conspirators at White Webbs kept up communications
with their friend and ally at Gothurst; so most likely
he was spared the anxiety of the news that on
Saturday, the 26th, Lord Mounteagle had received,
when at supper, an anonymous letter, warning him
to &#8220;devyse some exscuse&#8221;for absenting himself from
the &#8220;parleament,&#8221;and to &#8220;retyere&#8221;himself into the
&#8220;contri&#8221;where he might &#8220;expect the event in safti
for thoghe theare be no apparance of anni stir yet i
saye they shall receyve a terribel blowe this parleament
and yet they shall not seie who hurts them<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
&amp;c.&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and that Lord Mounteagle<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> ordered a man
in his service to read this letter then and there before
the party assembled. Most likely, too, Sir Everard
did not learn till much later that when, early in the
following week, Catesby and Winter heard of the
delivery of this letter of warning, they suspected
Tresham of being its author; that, on Wednesday,
the 30th, they summoned him, after he had been
down in Northamptonshire for about a week, to come
at once to White Webbs, with the full intention of
poignarding him on the spot, if they could convince
themselves that he had been guilty of writing and
sending the warning, and that he denied it, with
such firmness and so many oaths, that they hesitated
to assassinate him, while still doubting his sincerity.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 29th of October, Lady Digby, her
children, guests, and servants, started for Coughton, a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>journey of some fifty miles. In mentioning Coughton,
it may be worth noticing how many of those whose
names are more or less connected, even indirectly,
with the story of the Gunpowder Plot were related
to each other. The owner of Coughton, Thomas
Throckmorton, was a cousin both of Catesby&#8217;s and
of Tresham&#8217;s, although he never had anything to do
with the conspiracy. He was also a cousin of the
Vaux family, his grandmother having been a daughter
of a Lord Vaux of Harrowden.</p>

<p>It being known that Father Garnet was to be at
Coughton for All Hallows&#8217; Eve, All Saints&#8217; Day, and
All Souls&#8217; Day, many Catholics in the neighbourhood
came thither in order to attend mass and go to their
religious duties.</p>

<p>The feast of All-Hallows used then to be kept with
some solemnity, and it was Father Garnet&#8217;s custom
on such occasions to sing the mass,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> where it was
practicable and safe to do so, and also to preach.
Lingard<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> thought that it was &#8220;plain that Garnet
had acted very imprudently at Coughton, probably
had suffered expressions to escape him which, though
sufficiently obscure then, might now prove his acquaintance
with the plot; for he writes to Anne Vaux,
on March 4th, &#8216;there is some talk here of a discourse
made by me or Hall; I fear it is that which I made
at Coughton.&#8217;&mdash;Autib. 144.&#8221;He certainly recited
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>the prayer for the conversion of England, which had
been authorised for that purpose by Cardinal Allen;
and, although it was used that day throughout the
world, being taken from the office of the feast,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> his
doing so was afterwards used in evidence against him
as an act of treason. The words</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:28em;">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gentem auferte perfidam</span>
<span class="i0">Credentium de finibus,</span>
<span class="i0">Ut Christo laudes debitas</span>
<span class="i0">Persolvamus alacriter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
</div>

<p>from a hymn in the Office, had certainly no reference
to the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the second of November, Sir Everard
was up early, superintending the arrangements for
his start a day or two later, as well as the putting
away of valuables at Gothurst, and the closing of the
house in preparation for a long absence. Already
some of his horses and men had been sent on to
Dunchurch, together with his greyhounds, which were
all-important for appearance sake.</p>

<p>Possibly my readers may have experienced the
sensation caused by the unexpected and very sudden
arrival of a hitherto invariably welcome friend at
a moment when his presence was not exactly convenient.
Now few men, if any, were so dear to Sir
Everard as Father Gerard, and he used to be specially
welcome when he occasionally rode to Gothurst early
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>in a morning to say a mass in its chapel; but when
Sir Everard saw &#8220;his brother,&#8221;as he usually called
him, riding up to Gothurst on that particular
Saturday morning, and when he was told by the
Father that he had come to say his mass in his
chapel on this All Souls&#8217; Day, he wished, for the
first time, that his favourite guest had not taken
it into his head to come on that Saturday morning,
&#8220;of all Saturday mornings.&#8221;He knew that all the
chapel furniture, as well as the chalices, vestments,
and other necessaries for saying mass, had been
carefully hidden away, with the exception of those
which had been sent on to Dunchurch with a view
to having mass said during his stay there. Besides,
everything was in a state of fuss and confusion in
anticipation of the start; and, as his family were to remain
for some time at Coughton, the house was on the
point of being shut up. One reason why the presence
of Father Gerard might be particularly unwelcome
just then was that, about that time, Digby may
have been superintending the &#8220;great provision of
armour and shot, which he sent before him in a cart
with some trusty servants&#8221;to Dunchurch.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>When told that it would be impossible to have mass
at Gothurst that morning, Father Gerard, in addition
to his expression of disappointment&mdash;for All Souls&#8217; is
a Feast upon which no priest likes to miss saying
mass&mdash;may have shown signs of embarrassment;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>for the presence of a stranger prevented his asking his
host the reasons. As soon as an opportunity offered
itself, Father Gerard beckoned to Sir Everard to follow
him into a room in which they would be alone.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
There he told him that he could not understand the
sudden alteration in the arrangements of his house, the
putting away of so many things as if a long absence
was contemplated, the removal of the family to
Coughton, the preparations for a journey to Dunchurch
with such an unusual number of men and
horses, and&mdash;now that he came to think of it&mdash;the
sales of land and stock, of which Sir Everard had
spoken to him not long ago, as if to raise money for
some special purpose. All this, as an intimate friend,
Father Gerard was in a position to say to his so-called
&#8220;brother&#8221;; and he ventured to go further and inquire
whether he &#8220;had something in hand for the Catholic
cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard&#8217;s answer was &#8220;No, there is nothing in
hand that I know of, or can tell you of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Gerard then replied that he had some
reason to feel anxious on the subject, as Sir Everard
was much too careful a man to injure his estate by
leaving it understocked, and by selling any portion of
it in order to purchase horses, hire men, and spend
money in other ways, unless he had some great object
in view for what he believed to be the good of the
Catholic cause; and, added the Father, &#8220;Look well
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>that you follow counsel in your proceedings, or else
you may hurt both yourself and the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah! if some such words as these had been addressed
to him by Father Garnet at the time he first joined the
conspiracy, how much misery he might have been saved.</p>

<p>Perhaps Father Gerard&#8217;s persistence in suspecting
and implying that Sir Everard had &#8220;something in
hand,&#8221;after he had avowed that he had &#8220;nothing&#8221;
may have irritated him, for he replied, with dignity:
&#8220;I respect the Catholic cause much more than my
own commodity, as it should well appear whenever
I undertake anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Gerard was not to be put off in this manner,
and he asked once more, &#8220;whether there were anything
to be done,&#8221;and, if so, whether help was expected
from any foreign power.</p>

<p>Sir Everard was becoming hard pressed, and raising
one finger, he replied, &#8220;I will not adventure so much
in hope thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Distressed and anxious, Father Gerard then said&mdash;&#8220;I
pray God you follow counsel in your doings. If
there be any matter in hand, doth Mr Walley know
of it?&#8221;Walley was the name by which Father
Garnet, the Provincial of the Jesuits, was spoken of at
that time.</p>

<p>Digby&#8217;s answer was a curious one, unless Catesby had
not told him the name of the particular Jesuit whose
approval he pretended to have obtained. &#8220;In truth,
I think he doth not.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>Then, said Father Gerard, &#8220;In truth, Sir Everard
Digby, if there should be anything in hand, and that
you retire yourself and company into Warwickshire,
as into a place of most safety, I should think you did
not perform the part of a friend to some of your neighbours
not far off, and persons that, as you know,
deserve every respect, and to whom you have professed
much friendship, that they are left behind, and have
not any warning to make so much provision for their
own safety as were needful in such a time, but to
defend themselves from rogues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard, who must have sincerely wished that
his friend had stayed away, replied&mdash;&#8220;I warrant you
it shall not need.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this assurance Father Gerard felt rather more
satisfied, and shortly afterwards he rode away, much
to the relief of his host, who at any other time would
have pressed him to remain as his guest.</p>

<p>Sir Everard stayed at home over the Sunday&mdash;whether
he rode to some other Catholic&#8217;s house to
hear Mass on that day does not appear&mdash;and on the
Monday<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> he started for Dunchurch, accompanied by
his page, William Ellis, Richard Day, &#8220;his receaver,&#8221;
and five servants.</p>

<p>He can scarcely have left Gothurst in the best of
spirits, as he must have reflected that, for the first
time, he had prevaricated and dissembled, if not
actually lied, to the man he considered his best friend,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>the very priest who had received him into the Church;
that he had parted with him on a far from satisfactory
footing, and that he had been obliged to send him
away from his house without saying Mass on a day
of such importance to all good Catholics as that
devoted to the memory of and intercession for the
dead.</p>

<p>Besides these, he had other good reasons for
depression as he rode away from his beautiful home;
he must have known that, at best, he was starting
upon a very perilous enterprise; whether it succeeded
or failed, many of his party might fall on the field in
prosecuting it, if nothing worse happened to them;
and it may be that, as he caught a last glimpse of
Gothurst in the distance, the thought occurred to his
mind that he would never see it again.</p>

<p>The journey and his plans, however, would soon
distract his thoughts. The plot itself, too, would
occupy his mind above all other subjects. In each
of the conspirators it seems to have produced a sort
of intoxication. Stow says that,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> &#8220;being drunke
with the same folly,&#8221;Sir Everard Digby &#8220;went to
the appointed hunting at Don-church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there were his arms and his followers to be
thought of and looked after. It is difficult in these
days to realise that, some three hundred years ago,
the servants, retainers, and to some extent the tenants,
of large landowners were expected to fight when
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>required by their lords. It is true that the feudal
system had then almost ceased to exist; but although
vassalage had been considerably limited more
than a hundred years earlier by Henry VII., it was
not abolished by statute until more than fifty years
after the time of which I am writing.</p>

<p>To carry ourselves back to that period, we have to
imagine our gardeners, under-gardeners, grooms,
stable-helpers, gamekeepers, and perhaps footmen,
strapping on broad-swords, carrying pikes, putting on
such armour as could be provided, and going forth to
possible battle, some on foot, and some mounted on
hacks, coach-horses, cart-horses, and ponies, not a few
of which would be taken up from grass for the
purpose.</p>

<p>In this particular instance, the motley troop,
with the exception of the seven men accompanying
Sir Everard, had been already sent on, ostensibly
to assist at the coursing and, perhaps, hawking,
which was to take place at Dunchurch, while some
of them were to attend to the wants of the guests.
As to Sir Everard&#8217;s own journey, most of his attendants
rode; but one of them, Richard Hollis,
the under cook, walked, leading the &#8220;truncke-horse,&#8221;
on which his master&#8217;s personal clothing was
slung.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> This trunk, wrote Sir Everard,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> &#8220;had in it
cloathes of mine, as, a white Sattin Dublet cut with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>purple, a Jerkin and Hoase of De-roy colour sattin,
laid very thicke with Gold-lace, there were other
garments in it of mine, with a new black Winter
Gown of my wife&#8217;s, there was also in the trunk £300
in money.&#8221;</p>

<p>On reaching Dunchurch, Sir Everard took his supper
alone,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and it is not likely that his reflections as he
did so were of the calmest or the happiest.</p>

<p>Now that it takes considerably less than a couple
of hours to travel from London to Rugby, it seems
curious that no news of the difficulties of the conspirators
at White Webbs should have reached those at
Dunchurch; but it would have been dangerous in the
extreme to have sent a letter describing them, and
neither of the principals concerned wished to go far
from London until they had seen what would happen.</p>

<p>Their anxiety on Wednesday, the 30th of October,
had been increased by Tresham&#8217;s eagerness in urging
Catesby to give up the plot, which he said was discovered,
and to leave England, promising that he
should always &#8220;live upon his purse&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and by his
imploring Winter to begone, on Saturday, the 2nd of
November. On the Saturday or the Sunday, Winter
again met Tresham in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Walks, when the
latter declared that they were all lost men, unless they
saved themselves by instant flight. Through another
source, Catesby and Winter learned, on the Sunday,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>that the letter of warning which had been received by
Lord Mounteagle had been shown to the king, who
considered the matter of the highest importance, but
enjoined the strictest secrecy. The leading <ins title="Original word conspirtors"><a href="#TN">conspirators</a></ins>,
therefore, were in a state of great consternation
on the Sunday, two days before the explosion was to
take place. Of all this, however, Sir Everard Digby
knew nothing.</p>

<p>Either late on the Monday night, or early on the
Tuesday morning, several of Sir Everard&#8217;s friends
assembled at the Inn<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> where he was staying, at Dunchurch;
among these were Throckmorton,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Sir Robert
Digby of Coleshill, James Digby, George Digby,
Stephen Littleton and Humphrey Littleton. On the
Tuesday morning,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> mass was said by Father Hart, a
Jesuit, who had been a secular priest, and had been
introduced to Fathers of the Society of Jesus by
Father Strange,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s own chaplain.
The party, after breakfast, hunted or coursed, so that,
although the &#8220;hunting-match&#8221;was a mere cover for
other designs, it actually took place for one day.</p>

<p>It seems that Sir Everard took opportunities of confiding
to his friends the news that a scheme was on
foot for asserting the rights of Catholics; that active
measures of some sort were to be taken on their behalf
immediately in London, probably on the following day,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>and that very possibly the sportsmen assembled at
Dunchurch might receive a message, summoning them
to arms about Thursday or Friday; to some he told
more, and to some less, according to their dispositions
and the spirit in which they received his
information.</p>

<p>The sportsmen naturally conversed together upon
the intelligence they had received, although a few
of the more enlightened were to some extent tongue-tied,
and the whole party gradually became in an
anxious and excited state.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> This was especially the
case when they all met together at supper at the
inn after hunting, and more particularly as they
talked in groups over their tankards when supper
was finished.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby, his relative, Sir Robert Digby,
and one of the Littletons, withdrew from the rest
of the party to play cards<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> together in a room by
themselves.</p>

<p>A little distraction must have been very desirable
for Sir Everard&#8217;s mind in its state of tension. As
we know, he was usually an excellent card-player,
but we may doubt whether he played his best on
this occasion. He believed that the horrible catastrophe
was either at that moment taking place, had
just taken place, or was to take place immediately.
Perhaps, as he sat quietly playing cards, numbers of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>men whom he had known personally, or at least by
sight, had just been put to a horrible death, among
them his king, who had knighted him. The poor
princes, innocent boys, might be lying beside him,
dead also, crushed and mangled. Many among the
slain would be almost as innocent, so far as any
desire to injure the Catholics was concerned. Of
course, Digby had made up his mind that the
explosion was a necessary and even a heroic undertaking;
but, if bloodguiltiness there were in it, he
could not help knowing that it rested on his own
head. Can one help imagining that, while he played
cards, he must have devoutly wished, now that it
was too late, that he could prevent such a fearful
slaughter, or that he had never heard of or conspired
in the plot? Let us hope that the game of
cards diverted such thoughts; yet who could blame
him if, with such matters on his mind, he forgot
to follow suit?</p>

<p>At any rate, while he shuffled the cards, grim
realities would be apt to present themselves to his
memory. When would he hear of the great event?
It would only take place that afternoon or evening
at soonest. Dunchurch was about eighty miles from
London. Catesby would hardly despatch a messenger
until he had something definite to relate as to the
result of the catastrophe upon the minds of the
populace, the officials, and the army; so it might
be almost another twenty-four hours before Digby<span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>
could receive the news; yet such an appalling
massacre would be talked about, right and left, and
the intelligence would be passed on from one place
to another very rapidly; it was possible, therefore,
that tidings&mdash;most likely meagre, exaggerated, and
untrustworthy tidings&mdash;might reach Dunchurch, in
some form or other, on the following morning. As
the day wore on they might, perhaps, see Rookwood
himself, or one of his servants entrusted with a letter,
for he had placed relays of horses on the road between
London and Dunchurch.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Or Percy or Christopher
Wright might appear, as Sir Everard had sent a
servant with a couple of horses to meet them at
Hockliffe.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>But it was useless to disturb the mind as to the
particular moment at which the news could arrive;
possibly there was not at present any to send; therefore
it would be wisest, Sir Everard might tell himself,
to divert his mind with his game, to go early to
bed, and get a good night&#8217;s rest, so as to be fresh and
ready for whatever might happen on the following day.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sound without of many and
hurried footsteps; the door opened, and in rushed
Catesby, Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright,
Rookwood, and Winter, mud-bespattered, heavily
armed, and with grave faces. Acton and Grant
came in after them.</p>

<p>It was clear, at a glance, that something was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>wrong; and Sir Everard looked eagerly to Catesby
for information. Instead of speaking, Catesby took
him by the arm and led him out of the room, saying
nothing until he had found an empty chamber,
which they both entered alone.</p>

<p>Exactly what was said to Sir Everard by Catesby
can never be known; but what he had to tell him,
if he chose to do so, was much as follows.</p>

<p>On the evening, or late in the afternoon, of the
previous day (Monday, November 4th), Catesby,
Rookwood, John and Christopher Wright, Thomas
Winter, Percy, and Keyes, who formed the band of
conspirators in and about London, received notice
from Fawkes that the cellar in which their gunpowder
was laid had just been visited by the
Lord Chamberlain&mdash;the already mentioned Earl of
Suffolk, and Lord Mounteagle. Catesby and John
Wright immediately fled, and started for Dunchurch.
Christopher Wright, Rookwood, Keyes, Winter, and
Percy waited in London to observe what would
happen. They hung about during the night, and
at about four or five o&#8217;clock in the morning<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> they
discovered that Fawkes had been arrested. Then
Christopher Wright and Percy started for Dunchurch.</p>

<p>Only Rookwood, Winter, and Keyes now remained.
They were staying in the same lodging, and they
determined to wait and see what the morning would
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>bring forth.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> On going out early, they found the
populace in a state of great consternation and terror.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
&#8220;The news of Fawkes&#8217;s apprehension, and exaggerated
rumours of a frightful plot discovered, were
spread in every direction.&#8221;Guards and soldiers
protected all the streets and roads leading to the
palace, and no one, excepting officials, was permitted
to pass them. The whole town was in a state of
excitement. Keyes sprang on his horse and galloped
after the other fugitives; but Rookwood, who had
taken care to place relays of horses along the road
to Dunchurch, remained longer, in order to carry
the latest news to his fellow-conspirators in Warwickshire.
At ten<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> o&#8217;clock it became evident that it
would be dangerous to delay an instant longer, so
he also mounted his horse and galloped away.</p>

<p>The last of all to fly was Thomas Winter.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Of his
movements Catesby could have told Sir Everard
nothing; but he left London very soon after Rookwood,
and eventually joined his fellow-conspirators
at Huddington.</p>

<p>When Rookwood had gone about three miles
beyond Highgate, he overtook Keyes, and rode
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>with him into Bedfordshire, where Keyes took a
different road, as is conjectured by Jardine,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> for
&#8220;Lord Mordaunt&#8217;s house at Turvey, where his wife
resided.&#8221;Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Brick-hill,
a place not far from Fenny Stratford, Rookwood
overtook Percy, the two Wrights, and Catesby, after
which these five rode together to Ashby St Leger,
Lady Catesby&#8217;s place in Northamptonshire, which
was very near to Dunchurch. Roughly speaking,
the course of the fugitives had been not very wide
of the route of the London and North-Western
railway from Euston to Rugby, and while all did
it quickly, Rookwood&#8217;s pace was exceptionally fast,
as he rode about eighty miles between eleven in the
morning and six in the evening, averaging more than
eleven miles an hour, including stoppages to change
horses. He himself stated that he<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> &#8220;rode thirty
miles of one horse in two hours,&#8221;and that &#8220;Percy
and John Wright cast off their cloaks and threw
them into the hedge to ride the more speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five fugitives entered Lady Catesby&#8217;s house
just as she and her party, which included Robert
Winter and Acton, were sitting down to supper.
The news of the arrest of Fawkes and the failure of
the main design having been announced by the new
arrivals, who, as Jardine says, were<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> &#8220;fatigued and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>covered with dirt,&#8221;&mdash;Father Gerard, again, in describing
their ride, writes of<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> &#8220;the foulness of the
winter ways&#8221;&mdash;no time was lost over the hurried
meal, during which a short conference took place,
ending in a decision that the whole party should
ride off immediately to Dunchurch, taking with
them all the arms that were in the house.</p>

vexed question of the authorship of this letter. Nor can I here inquire
whether Mounteagle was privy to the plot. A very affectionate letter
from Mounteagle to Catesby is given in <i>Archæologia</i>, Vol. xxviii. pp.
423-4, and with it are some interesting remarks by Mr Bruce upon this
subject. He infers from some, at first sight, playful words about &#8220;the
ellimentes of Aier and fyre,&#8221;and &#8220;the fyre of your spirite,&#8221;that
Mounteagle referred to the Gunpowder Plot; and he suspects that in
telling Catesby that he &#8220;accumptes thy person the only sone that must
Ripene our harvest,&#8221;Mounteagle implies that Catesby is the chief
instigator of the great blow that is to deliver the Catholics from persecution.
The letter invites Catesby to meet him at Bath, and Mr
Bruce says, &#8220;Catesby went to Bath about Michaelmas 1605, it now
appears, in consequence of the above invitation. Percy, and, as we
may conclude, Lord Mounteagle, met him there.&#8221;This must have
been either immediately before, or immediately after, Catesby revealed
the Plot to Sir Everard Digby. Mr Bruce thinks before.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>It is to be lamented that Catesby, not content with
giving an account of the failure of the plot to Sir
Everard Digby, added to it a lie. In his examination,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Digby stated that Catesby &#8220;told him that now
was the time for men to stirre in the Catholick cause,
for though the sayd Ro. Katesbie had bin disappointed
of his first intention, yet there was such a pudder
bredd in the State by <i>y<sup>e</sup> death of the King and the
Earle of Salisburie</i>, as if true Catholiques would
now stirre, he doubted not but they might procure
to them selves good conditions. Wherefore by all
the bondes of frendshippe to him self and all which
that cause might require at this examt<sup>s</sup>. handes, he
urged this exam<sup>t</sup>. to proceede in that businesse as
him self and all that companie would do, and as he
had great assurance all other Catholiques in those
parts would do the like: telling me that there were
two gentlemen in the companie, naming the Littletons,
that would bring 1000 men the next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King and Lord Salisbury both killed, and a
promise of a thousand men from one family alone!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span></p>
<p>This was something to start with, even though the
parliament had not been destroyed; and in the
general &#8220;pudder&#8221;that had been &#8220;bredd,&#8221;the
Catholics might possibly succeed in obtaining good
terms, if not the reins of government. So was Sir
Everard persuaded by Catesby, who was not only
a traitor to his country, but a deceiver of his
friends.</p>

<p>The conspirators assumed that their names would
be soon, if not already, known to the Government,
as Fawkes would almost certainly be tortured until
he revealed them; and, brave as he was, there was no
saying whether he would be able to withstand the
temptations of putting an end to his agonies on the
rack by giving the names of his employers and
accomplices.</p>

<p>Besides all this, Catesby pretended that their case
was by no means hopeless. No Catholics were more
discontented with the Government than those in Wales
and the English counties which bordered on it; few,
again, as a body, were more powerful. Let the party
at Dunchurch, therefore, start at once, said Catesby,
with their servants and retainers, ride through
Warwickshire and Worcestershire into Wales, rallying
the Catholic gentry with their followers to their
standard as they went along; and, so soon as they
should be in considerable numbers, let them proclaim
a general insurrection of the Catholics of England.
Were it once to be known that a Catholic army was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
established in the West, others would certainly be
raised in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>One man of power and influence he felt sure he
could count upon: this was Talbot<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> of Grafton&mdash;a
place not far from Coughton. Talbot was a zealous
Catholic; he was heir presumptive to the Earldom of
Shrewsbury; and his wife was a daughter of the Sir
William Petre who had been Secretary of State to
Queen Mary. He would be the more likely to join
them, as he had suffered imprisonment and penalties
for his religion under Elizabeth. Another reason for
hoping for his adherence was the fact that his son-in-law,
Robert Winter, was already one of the sworn
conspirators, and had slept at his house only two
nights earlier. Percy also came in and said that he
was certain &#8220;all forces in those parts about Mr Talbot
would assist&#8221;them. This assurance evidently weighed
considerably with Sir Everard; for he afterwards
wrote<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;We all thought if we could procure Mr
Talbot to rise that ... that was not little, because
we had in our Company his Son-in-Law, who gave us
some hope of, and did not much doubt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of one thing there could be no sort of question; if
action was to be taken at all, it must be taken at
once, and without the delay of a moment: time was
everything; the rapid journey of the conspirators
from London was already much in their favour, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>this advantage would be thrown away if there were to
be any dallying or indecision. Grafton, Talbot&#8217;s place,
was about five and twenty miles from where they
were then standing, and it would be of the utmost
importance to reach it, or send an envoy there, early
the next morning.</p>

<p>Before condemning Digby for proceeding further,
now that the main plot had failed, we must remember
that he had sworn to be faithful to the conspiracy, and
that, in their present straits, it might have been as
much as his life was worth to refuse to go on with
Catesby and his fellows. We have seen how narrowly
Tresham escaped Catesby&#8217;s dagger.</p>

<p>There were others, however, not bound by any
oath or promise, whose immediate support was required.
The so-called hunting-party assembled at
the inn must needs be enlisted in the service. Scraps
of the terrible news had already been passed from
one to the other; for many, if not most of them,
were well acquainted with the fugitives from London,
and were eagerly questioning them concerning particulars.
Digby and Catesby found the party in a
state of great excitement when they went to summon
them formally to join in the insurrection.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Sir Everard Digby and the
disgust of Catesby, instead of rallying as one man
to the call to arms, almost as one man they refused,
with horror, to have anything whatever to do with
an enterprise which had begun with an attempt at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
wholesale massacre, and promised to end in the
hanging, drawing, and quartering of all who had
a share in it.</p>

<p>Sir Everard&#8217;s own uncle, Sir Robert Digby,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> was
the very first to charge the conspirators with being
a band of traitors, and to order his men and horses
to be got ready for immediate departure. With
scarcely any exceptions, the other guests followed
his example, not only condemning the treason, but
also reproaching the traitors with having gravely
injured the Catholic cause. To join in a legitimate
warfare, even a civil warfare, was one thing; to
acquiesce in an attempted murder, a murder on a
gigantic scale, and to endeavour to profit by the
terror brought about by that attempted murder,
was quite another. And besides all this; if they
complained of having been invited to hunt and
hawk at Dunchurch on false pretences, who could
blame them? No doubt they were very angry.
Besides, they were but mortal, and to be suddenly
disturbed and required to decide hastily upon a most
serious question, involving immediate action, is more
disagreeable during the process of digestion, just
after the principal meal of the day, than at any
other time; and as the country squires, who had
come to Dunchurch to enjoy good sport, scrambled
into their uncleaned, and very likely but half-dried
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>riding-clothes, and went out into the dark, damp
night, to mount their horses for long, dreary journeys
over bad roads towards their homes, they cannot
have felt in the best of tempers.</p>

<p>It may be worth noticing here, that Sir Robert
was not the only member of the Digby family who
gave the Government assistance in respect to the
Gunpowder Plot.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> &#8220;Lord Harrington, who had
the care of the Princess Elizabeth, having received
some intimation of an attempt to seize her, immediately
sent up John Digby, a younger son of Sir
George Digby, to court, with an account of all he
knew; where the young gentleman told the tale
so well as to acquire thereby the King&#8217;s good graces,
who not long after knighted, employed him in
long negotiation in Spain, and Sep. 15th, 1622,
created him Earl of Bristol. His son was the famous
George Digby, &amp;c.&#8221;Accordingly, if the Gunpowder
Plot marred the fortunes of one branch of the Digby
family, it made those of another!</p>

<p>Sir Everard was as much astonished as he was
dispirited at finding that the &#8220;powder-action,&#8221;far
from being approved of, was repudiated with horror
by the friends whom he had assembled at Dunchurch.
He had expected them to have looked at the matter in
a very different light. He can scarcely have failed now
to see that, even if the plot had succeeded, the
Catholics, as a body, would have condemned it, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>refused to profit by it. Still he was weak enough to
yield to Catesby&#8217;s urgent requests to proceed with the
insurrection and to endeavour to raise forces in
Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Wales.</p>

<p>The band of conspirators, with the very few friends
who chose to stay with them, then held a council of
war; they were &#8220;prepared to stand in Armes and raise
rebellion,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and they determined to start at once on
their journey, so as to enlist Mr Talbot to their support,
as early as possible on the morrow, and give him
the whole day to rally his numerous retainers round
the standard of the little army of traitors and would-be
murderers.</p>

<p>Although five of the party had just ridden eighty
miles at considerable speed, they swung themselves
into the saddle again for a long night&#8217;s march. Even
if the whole hunting-party had remained there would
not have been a large body of horsemen; in all the
number present at Dunchurch was only eighty;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> but
some of the friends who had refused to have anything
to do with the expedition were influential men, who
could soon have raised substantial troops, even from
among their own retainers. The party that actually
started from Dunchurch under the command of the
conspirators, according to Sir Everard Digby,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> &#8220;were
not above fiftie horse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>It was a wretched little cavalcade: if it had anything
military about it, it was more of a recruiting
party than an army, and its stealthy creeping forth
from the inn, that November night, in darkness and
dejection, was very different from the triumphant dash
of the entire &#8220;hunting-party&#8221;upon Combe Abbey, to
seize the Princess Elizabeth and take her from the
keeping of Lord Harington, which had been laid down
in the programme. The discovery of the plot, the
arrest of Fawkes, and the seizure of the gunpowder
was bad enough; and now, the refusal of the trusted,
influential, and powerful Catholic landowners who had
been assembled at Dunchurch to have hand or part in
what they considered a detestable rebellion, added ten-fold
to the disappointment of Sir Everard and his
companions.</p>

<p>The road of the rebels lay through Warwick, and it
was remembered that there, in the stable of a poor
horse-breaker of cavalry re-mounts, they would be able
to supply themselves with fresh horses. Even two of
the leading conspirators&mdash;I wish I could say that Sir
Everard Digby had been one of them&mdash;winced at this
act of felony! Rookwood, as he subsequently admitted
in examination,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> &#8220;meant not to adventure
himself in stealing any&#8221;horses, as he had already
fifteen or sixteen; and Robert Winter<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> tried to persuade
Catesby &#8220;to let it alone, alleging that it would
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>make a great uproar in the country, and that once
done,&#8221;they &#8220;might not rest anywhere, the country
would so rise about&#8221;them.</p>

<p>Catesby&#8217;s reply was ominous. &#8220;Some of us may
not look back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But others,&#8221;said Winter, &#8220;I hope, may, and
therefore, I pray you, let this alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Catesby spoke words in ill accordance with
those which he had used to encourage Digby before
leaving Dunchurch. &#8220;What! hast thou any hope,
Robin? I assure thee there is none that knoweth of
this action but shall perish.&#8221;</p>

<p>On reaching Warwick, they left the trunk-horses
with their attendants<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> at the entrance to the town,
in case their intended raid should lead to any scrimmage
or retaliation; and then they proceeded to the
horse-breakers&#8217; stable and stole nine or ten horses.
This took about half-an-hour, and when the robbery
had been accomplished, they sent back for the trunk-horses
and proceeded on their night-journey.</p>

<p>It was not far from Warwick to Norbrook, the
house of John Grant, one of the conspirators. Here
they made a brief halt, and, on entering the hall, they
found two tables furnished with muskets and armour.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
After taking a very short rest&mdash;William Handy, one
of Sir Everard&#8217;s servants, says half-an-hour;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> but
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>Jardine says an hour or two,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and Richard Hollis, a
servant of Sir Everard&#8217;s, says, &#8220;some howres,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>&mdash;the
cavalcade again started on its dark nocturnal march.
The intention of its leaders was to ride to Huddington,
near Droitwich, the house of Robert Winter; and on
the way thither, to send a messenger a little to the
right of their road, with a letter to Father Garnet at
Coughton, explaining the desperate position in which
they were placed. On arriving at Huddington, their
host was to be sent to his father-in-law, Talbot of
Grafton, to inform him of all that had happened, and
to urge him to join the insurrection with as many
men as he could muster.</p>

<p>Some time after sunrise, which does not take place
at that time of the year till after seven o&#8217;clock, they
drew near Alcester, and despatched their messenger to
Coughton. The man chosen was Catesby&#8217;s servant,
Thomas Bates, the only menial who was a sworn conspirator.
Besides the letter to Father Garnet, he was
entrusted with one for Lady Digby, written by her
husband.</p>

<p>The most trying part of Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s long
and gloomy ride must have been to pass within a
couple of miles of his wife and children, as he went
through Alcester in the early morning, without going
to see them. Well-horsed, as he was, it might
almost appear that he could have made time to visit
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>them for at least a few minutes, and then ridden on to
Huddington, where the expedition was to make a long
halt. Did he hesitate to go to Coughton through fear
of Catesby, or was he afraid to trust himself in the
presence of his wife?</p>

<p>When Bates arrived at Coughton, he was taken at
once to Father Garnet, who was in the hall,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and he
handed the letter to the priest, who opened it and
read it in silence.</p>

<p>I will give Father Garnet&#8217;s own description<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> of this
letter, which &#8220;was subscribed by Sir E. Digby and
Catesbye.&#8221;&#8220;The effect of this letter was to excuse
their rashness, and required my assistance in Wales,
and persuade me to make a party, saying that if I had
scrupulosity or desire to free myself or my Order from
blame and let them now perish, I should follow after
myselfe and all Catholics.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Father Garnet was reading the letter, Father
Greenway came in and asked what was the matter.
Thereupon Father Garnet read the letter in the hearing
of Bates, and said to Greenway, &#8220;They would have
blown up the Parliament House, and were discovered
and we all utterly undone.&#8221;Father Greenway replied
that in that case &#8220;there was no tarrying for himself
and Garnet.&#8221;Then Bates begged Father Greenway to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>go with him to Catesby, his master, if he really wished
to help him. Father Greenway answered that he
&#8220;would not forbear to go unto him though it were
to suffer a thousand deaths, but that it would overthrow
the state of the whole society of the Jesuits&#8217;
order.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Father Garnet had read the letter to Father
Greenway, the latter exclaimed, &#8220;All Catholics are
undone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Garnet, in an intercepted letter, gives a
pathetic account of the effect of her husband&#8217;s letter
upon Lady Digby.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> &#8220;My Lady Digby came. What
did she? Alas! what, but cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tells us, too, the answer which he gave to the
messenger, Bates. &#8220;That I marvelled they would
enter into such wicked actions and not be ruled by the
advice of friends and order of His Holiness generally
given to all, and that I could not meddle but wished
them to give over, and if I could do anything in such
a matter (as I neither could nor would) it were in vain
now to attempt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two fathers drew aside and talked together
for half-an-hour, while Bates walked up and down the
hall. After this, Father Greenway went to prepare
himself for his journey, and presently came out with
Bates, mounted a horse, and rode with him to
Huddington in order to see his penitent, Catesby.</p>

<p>Father Greenway&#8217;s riding companion was not only
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>one of the conspirators, but had helped<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> &#8220;in making
provision of their powder.&#8221; He confessed in prison
the whole matter of his having been sent by Catesby,
his master, with a letter to Father Garnet at Coughton,
and that Father Greenway had accompanied him from
that house to Huddington in order to visit Catesby.</p>

<p>We must return to Sir Everard, as he rode from
Alcester to Huddington. One of his servants, named
Hardy, came up to him, during this part of his
journey, and asked him<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> what was to become &#8220;of
him and the rest of his poore servants,&#8221;who, as he
pitifully protested, had not been &#8220;privy to this
bloudy faction.&#8221;Such a question, although it did
not savour of mutiny, showed an inclination to defection,
and must have added considerably to his
master&#8217;s discouragement. The answer which he
gave to it was as follows:&mdash;&#8220;I believe you were
not;&#8221;<i>i.e.</i>, privy to the plot; &#8220;but now there is no
remedy.&#8221;The servant then let out that it was not
solely on his own account that he had asked the
question; for he went on to implore his master to
yield himself to the king&#8217;s mercy; whereupon Sir
Everard said sharply that he would permit no servant
to utter such words in his presence.</p>

<p>Catesby and his band of warriors, brigands, horse-stealers,
professors of physical force, or whatever else
the reader may please to call them, reached Huddington
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>about two o&#8217;clock on the Wednesday afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The
first thing they did was to place sentinels round the
house,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> which was rendered suitable for defence by
its moat.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Then they proceeded to take their first
long rest, that is to say, until early on the following
morning, a sorely needed period of refreshment and
repose, especially for those who had ridden the whole
way from London. Where so large a party can have
been entertained and lodged at Huddington, it is
difficult to understand, as the house, which is now
used as a farm, rich as it is in carved oak, is not, and
probably never was, a large one.</p>

<p>During the first few hours of their stay, however, the
leading conspirators were awaiting the return of the
envoy from Grafton with too much anxiety to be able
to sleep or take their ease. Almost everything hung
upon the reply of Talbot. The assistance of the
large number of men and horses which it was in
his power to supply was of the utmost importance
at that very critical moment, and on his influence
and example might depend the attitude of all the
Catholic gentry in Worcestershire, as well as in
several of the counties adjoining it.</p>

<p>Just as it was beginning to grow dark, two horse<span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>men
rode up to the door of Huddington, and the
ambassadors, Robert Winter and Stephen Littleton,
entered the house. Sir Everard Digby and Catesby
eagerly went up to them and asked the result of
their embassy; but, before they had had time to
reply, it was evident from the expression of their
faces that they brought bad news. On reaching
Grafton, said Winter, they found that the report of
the Gunpowder Plot and its failure had arrived there
before them. Their approach had been observed,
perhaps watched for, and, as they rode up to the
curious &#8220;L&#8221;-shaped house, with its gothic chapel
at one end of it, Sir John Talbot himself stood at its
arched doorway,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> with a frown upon his countenance.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
As soon as they were within earshot, he forbade them
to enter his house. He then told them that he had
already heard of the plot, which he condemned in
the strongest terms, together with all that had been,
or were, connected with it, whether personal friends
of his own or otherwise. He was a very zealous
Catholic, and he regarded the whole conspiracy as
one of the worst evils that could possibly have befallen
the Catholics of England, since it would bring scandal
upon their very name, and increase the persecutions
which they suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>When Robert Winter not only defended the plot
but urged Sir John to join the band of Catholics who
intended to make a struggle for their freedom, his
father-in-law threatened that, although he was a
Catholic, a neighbour, and his son-in-law, he would
have him arrested if he did not make off as quickly
as his horse&#8217;s legs could carry him.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Robert Winter had finished his story,
the conspirators were plunged into the deepest dejection.
Not one of them would be more depressed by
the bad news than Sir Everard Digby. The rest
were all more or less of a wild adventurous spirit,
and probably had realised sooner than he to what a
desperate issue the conspiracy had already arrived;
but Sir Everard had been deceived by Catesby into
believing the king and Salisbury to be dead, and until
now he had clung to the hope that the best Catholics
in England, when they heard of what had been attempted,
would unite with himself and his companions
in a holy war. Sir John Talbot was the type of
Catholic by whose side he had hoped to fight for the
faith, a man full of zeal and unflinching energy for
the Catholic cause, as well as an honourable English
gentleman. It was chiefly on the guarantee of his
adherence and assistance, too, that Sir Everard had
consented to Catesby&#8217;s entreaties to ride away from
Dunchurch with the rest of the conspirators, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>attempt to raise the Catholics against the Government;
and now Sir John Talbot repudiated Sir
Everard, his friends, and his actions.</p>

<p>A more gloomy party than that at Huddington
can rarely have been assembled at an English
country house. The hostess, Robert Winter&#8217;s wife,
was indeed to be pitied. In her presence there
was<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> &#8220;no talk of rebellion,&#8221;as she afterwards declared;
but she must have known what was going
forward, and have learned something of the disastrous
failure of the appeal to her father, whose censure of
her husband must have caused her the greatest pain.
A few weeks later she was made to endure the
distress of an examination before officials on the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the day, Father Greenway came
to Huddington with Catesby&#8217;s servant, Thomas Bates.
Sir Everard does not appear to have seen him, for
he wrote<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;They said Mr Greenway came to Huddington
when we were there and had speech of Mr&#8221;
[probably Catesby], &#8220;but I told them it was more
than I took note of, and that I did not know him
very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catesby, however, received Father Greenway with
delight. On first seeing him, he exclaimed that
&#8220;Here at least was a gentleman who would live and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>die with them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> But Greenway seems to have paid
them a very short visit; and he was evidently commissioned
by Catesby to go to a neighbouring landlord
and enlist him to the cause; for he rode away the same
afternoon to Henlip, or Hindlip,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> a house about four
miles off, belonging to Thomas Abington, or Habingdon,
a man famed for his hospitality to priests flying from
persecution. On arriving at Hindlip, Father Greenway
told Abington that he had<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> &#8220;brought them the
worst newes that ever they hade, and sayd they were
all undone&#8221;; that &#8220;ther were certayne gentlemen that
meant to have blown upp the Parliament house, and
that ther plot was discovered a day or two before, and
now ther were gathered together some forty horse at
Mr Wynter&#8217;s house, meaning Catesbye, Percye, Digby,
and others, and tould them,&#8221;<i>i.e.</i>, Abington and his
household, &#8220;their throates would be cutt unlesse they
presently wente to joyne with them.&#8221;Abington
replied, &#8220;Alas, I am sorye;&#8221;but he said that he<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>&#8220;would never ioyne with them in that matter, and
chardged all his house to that purpose not to goe
unto them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Oldcorne, another Jesuit, was present at
Hindlip<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> when this interview took place, and he also
assured Father Greenway that<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> he would have nothing
to do with the conspiracy or the insurrection. As we
shall have little, if anything, more to do with Father
Greenway, it may be worth observing here that he
escaped from England<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> in &#8220;a small boat laden with dead
pigs, of which cargo he passed as the owner,&#8221;and that
he lived thirty years afterwards. A ridiculous story was
reported from Naples, in 1610, by Sir Edwin Rich, that
Father Greenway (alias Beaumont) was plotting to send
King James some poisoned clothes, which would be
death to the wearer.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>While at Huddington, Sir Everard and most of
the other conspirators probably went to confession to
Father Hart, the priest who had said mass for them
at Dunchurch; for he was afterwards &#8220;charged with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>having heard the confessions and absolved the conspirators,
two days after the discovery of the Plot,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
and this is confirmed by Sir Everard&#8217;s servant,
Handy, who said<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> &#8220;that on Thursday morning about
three of the clock all the said companie as servaunts
as others heard masse, receaved the sacrament and
were confessed, w<sup>ch</sup>. masse was said by a priest
named Harte, a little man, whitely complexion and
a little beard.&#8221;If the conspirators really made full
confessions with true sorrow for their terrible sins,
on this occasion, nothing could have been better
or more opportune. If not,&mdash;well, the less said
the better! The same witness stated that on that
Thursday morning, at about six o&#8217;clock, Sir Everard,
who had had four fresh horses sent to him from
Coughton,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> and the rest of the party were again in
the saddle, and the whole band started in a northerly
direction for Whewell Grange, a house belonging to
Lord Windsor, having added to the procession &#8220;a
cart laden w<sup>th</sup>. trunckes, pikes, and other munition,&#8221;
from Huddington. On their way towards Whewell
Grange &#8220;four of the principall gent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> rode in
front of the procession, and four behind it &#8220;to kepe
the company from starting away,&#8221;<i>i.e.</i>, deserting.</p>

<p>They reached Lord Windsor&#8217;s house,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> about noon,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>
and all dismounted, &#8220;saving some fewe whoe sate on
their horses to watch whoe should come unto the
howse.&#8221;They then made their second raid. It was
not for horses, as at Warwick; this time they sought
for arms and armour, of which there was a large
store at Whewell Grange. They appear to have
met with no resistance, from which we may infer
that, to use a modern and vulgar phrase, &#8220;the
family were from home.&#8221;When they had all armed
themselves, they put the remainder into a cart, while
they filled another with a quantity of powder. These
two carts then formed part of the procession. Sir
Everard Digby can scarcely have failed to feel shame
at the plunder of Whewell Grange. What had Lord
Windsor done that his house should be pillaged?
He had served his country as a sailor, and he
eventually became a Rear Admiral of the Fleet.
Why should his things be taken feloniously from
his home during his absence? His father had died
only seven months earlier, and the funeral hatchment
was most likely hanging over the doorway when
these thieves entered. While the robbers were
ransacking the house&mdash;I fear that Sir Everard
Digby was among them&mdash;some of the neighbouring
peasants and villagers came up, out of curiosity, to
see what was going on. As he came out of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>house, Catesby saw from twenty to thirty of them
standing about.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come with us?&#8221;said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we would, if we knew what you mean
to do,&#8221;was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are for God and the country!&#8221;said Catesby.</p>

<p>Then one of the men, who was leaning with his
back against a wall, struck the ground with his stick
and cried, &#8220;We are for the King James, as well as
for God and the country, and we will not go against
his will.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, with their arms, armour, gunpowder, and
horses, which had been for the most part begged,
borrowed, or stolen, the little party of filibusters
started again, in a northerly direction, towards
Holbeche House, Stephen Littleton&#8217;s place in Staffordshire.
Although more soldierlike in appearance,
owing to their armour&mdash;their want now was not of
armour, but of men to wear it&mdash;they felt much less
martial at heart than on leaving Dunchurch two days
earlier. They were greatly discouraged at finding
that no volunteers rallied to their ranks; that, when
they rode up to the houses of any of the Catholic
gentry, they were invariably driven with reproaches
and ignominy from their doors as the greatest enemies
of the Catholic cause, which they were told they had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>brought into disrepute by their misguided and
iniquitous zeal.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>&#8220;Notwithstanding of their fair shews and pretence
of their Catholick cause,&#8221;says Bishop Barlow, &#8220;no
creature, man or woman, through all that countrey
would once so much as give them willingly a cup of
drink, or any sort of comfort or support, but with
execrations detested them.&#8221;This not only chilled the
hearts of the leaders, but also alarmed their followers,
who saw them leaving one large Catholic house after
another crestfallen in expression and without a single
recruit in their train. To add to their depression, the
roads were bad, and in many places deep with mud,
and the weather was stormy and very wet.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Instead
of increasing, as Sir Everard and his friends had
hoped and expected, their numbers steadily diminished,
and they were soon reduced to thirty-six or
less.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Their men still further lagged behind and
disappeared, and the leaders of the expedition threatened
those who remained that the next man who
attempted to desert should be instantly shot. When
they rested, Sir Everard and his companions took it
in turn to watch their men with a loaded pistol,
determined to make an example of the first deserter
they could get a shot at. When they rode on, they
endeavoured to be equally vigilant; but with such
a straggling, wearied, undisciplined cavalcade, in a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>wooded country like Worcestershire, on a dark and
misty November afternoon, it was impossible to
prevent men from sneaking away unperceived, and
the desertions hourly continued.</p>

<p>Sir Everard&#8217;s spirits drooped more and more.
&#8220;Not one man came to take our part, though we
expected so many,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> he says. As to the common
people in the villages and the small towns through
which the irregular train passed, they merely stood
and gazed at them without showing the least inclination
to join them.</p>

<p>In the course of the day (Thursday, Nov. 7th), Sir
Everard and his allies had a fresh cause of anxiety.
On looking back, one of them descried a small body
of horsemen in the distance. Filled with hope,
thinking that it consisted of Catholics from the neighbourhood
coming to join them, they halted, to enable
the riders to come up, but, to their disappointment,
the other party pulled up also. This was suspicious,
and still more so when the mysterious group moved
slowly after them on their starting again. Evidently
the horsemen in their rear were watching their movements
with no friendly intentions. To the conspirators,
their distant but ever following figures
must have produced sensations not unlike those caused
to worn-out travellers by the appearance of vultures
in the desert. So long as it was light, they kept
catching occasional glimpses of them, and, worst of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>all, the band of &#8220;shadowers&#8221;was increasing in
numbers and venturing nearer and nearer. The conspirators
and their followers were not in actual flight;
indeed, they professed to be recruiting for their
&#8220;army&#8221;; but they were none the less steadily, if
slowly, pursued by a body of horsemen exceeding
their own in numbers, though not so well armed.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine anything more
wretched than the little band of conspirators as
they wended their way through the Warwickshire,
Worcestershire, and Staffordshire lanes and villages.
Fagged and haggard were the men, on jaded and
weary steeds, and their helmets, pikes, and pistols
gave them an almost comical appearance of martial
masquerade. The cart-loads of unused armour
and weapons were terribly suggestive of failure,
and the conspirators&#8217; appeals to the able-bodied
men, who stood gazing at them from the doors
of wayside inns and from village cross-roads,
were met either with insult, laughter, or stolid
indifference.</p>

<p>To a man like Sir Everard Digby, who had
been accustomed to meet with respect, honour,
and deference wherever he went, all this must have
been exceptionally galling, and it would be made
the more bitter by his observing that several of his
companions were passing through a part of the
country where they were well known and once
honoured. He had expected to be received with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
cheers and enthusiasm at every Catholic house on
his route for his attempt to better the condition of
his co-religionists, and to see squires, yeomen, and
peasants either hurrying to horse and to arms, or
imploring for a headpiece and a sword or halberd
from the store in the waggons of the little train;
and what did he find?&mdash;the door of every Catholic
house shut against him, or only opened for an out-pouring
of reproaches and repudiations; the Catholics,
from the highest to the lowest, shaking their heads
at him and bidding him begone; and his carts of
arms, armour, and gunpowder eyed with anger,
scorn, and derision. Instead of regarding him as
the best friend of their cause, the Catholic squires
treated him as if he were its worst enemy; and, as
they turned their backs upon himself and his friends
and his followers, they gave him to understand
that they considered the &#8220;powder-action,&#8221;which he
protested was intended for the relief of the professors
of the ancient faith, one of the most madly-conceived,
iniquitous, and prejudicial projects ever
undertaken by people bearing the name of Christians.</p>

<p>When we think of Sir Everard Digby accoutred
and armed as if he were the leader of an army
numbered by thousands, but actually surrounded
by little more than a couple of dozen bedraggled
and disheartened horsemen, all heavily, indeed over-armed,
yet weary and unmilitary-looking to the
last degree, himself haggard and anxious in counten<span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>ance,
yet vainly endeavouring to keep up a martial,
knightly, and prosperous bearing, under conditions
that rendered any such attempt ridiculous, we are
inevitably reminded of that famous character of fiction,
Don Quixote de la Mancha.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>Much time had been lost on the Thursday afternoon,
in going hither and thither, on either side of the
route, in the vain hope of persuading the Catholic
knights and squires, who lived in the neighbourhood,
to join the insurgents; even after dark Digby and his
allies continued these fruitless endeavours, in defiance
of the band of horsemen that was dogging their footsteps
at some distance in the rear; and it was nearly
ten o&#8217;clock at night<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> before the rapidly diminishing
and draggled party reached its destination at
Holbeche House, the home of Stephen Littleton.</p>

<p>Holbeche was a large and handsome Elizabethan
mansion<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> standing a little way over the South Border
of Staffordshire; about four miles to the north of
Stourbridge, and a trifle less to the West of Dudley,
on what are now the outskirts of the great coal and
iron district known as the &#8220;black country.&#8221;It was a
relief to find a resting-place of any sort; and, if the
sensations of the conspirators and their followers had
much in common with wild beasts tracked to their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>lairs, or foxes run to ground, they were, at any rate,
within walls which would afford them a temporary
protection, and enable them to take a little of the rest
and refreshment which they now so much required.</p>

<p>They had not, however, much leisure for repose.
They may have learned that the ominous band of
horsemen, which had persistently shadowed their
progress, had consisted of Sir Richard Walsh, the
Sheriff of Worcestershire, a number of country gentlemen
who had rallied to his assistance, and a <i>posse
comitatus</i>. Although no enemy was any longer in
sight, they knew that their position had been ascertained,
that spies were probably on the watch for any
attempted movement on their part, and that they were
to all intents and purposes besieged. Worn out as
they were with fatigue and anxiety, they set to work,
therefore, to prepare the house to withstand an assault,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
and spent most of the night thus occupied; so they
cannot have had much sleep.</p>

<p>At last Sir Everard Digby had completely lost heart.
Worse still, he felt that he had been deceived. &#8220;He
began to suspect that&#8221;the stories which Catesby and
Percy had told him of the assistance which Talbot and
the Littletons would bring, were not so much mistakes
as untruths &#8220;devised to engage him in theyr desperate
cases.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> During the night he still cherished the hope
that some strong forces might come to their aid, a hope
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>which he would hardly have entertained unless it
had been encouraged by Catesby and the other conspirators;
but when the day began to dawn and it
was evident there were no &#8220;succors coming thyther,&#8221;
he &#8220;discryed the falshood of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether he informed Catesby of his determination
to throw up the whole undertaking does not appear.
He may have made the excuse of going away to try to
raise men for their help, or of ascertaining whether
there were any symptoms of an approaching attack
from without. To proclaim himself a deserter from
the cause to Catesby would have been to risk a
dangerous interview, in which the clinking of swords
or the crack of a pistol would be likely to be heard
above the interchange of bitter words; and judging
from Catesby&#8217;s and Winter&#8217;s intentions in a certain
interview with Tresham, it was more than possible
that a sudden stab with a dagger might have given
a practical demonstration of Catesby&#8217;s opinion of
renegades.</p>

<p>&#8220;About daie light,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> on the Friday morning, he sent
his page, William Ellis, and another of his servants,
named Michael Rapior, on before him, and presently
followed them, accompanied by the rest of his men,
with the deliberate intention &#8220;to have yealded him
self,&#8221;and I cannot but suspect that he did so without
telling Catesby.</p>

<p>He overtook Ellis and Rapior within a mile of Hol<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>beche,
and, telling his servants how desperate he
believed their case to be, he made them all a present
of their horses and whatever money belonging to him
they happened to have upon them; he then freed them
from his service and advised them to make their escape
as best they could.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> William Ellis and one other, however,
&#8220;said they would never leave him, but against
their will.&#8221;Sir Everard made up his mind to go to
&#8220;Sir Foulk Greville&#8221;and surrender himself, and he
began to ask everybody whom he met on the road the
way to his house.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> As Sir Fulke Greville<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> had already
obtained Warwick Castle, and was probably living
there, Sir Everard must have expected to have a long
ride before him.</p>

<p>The three horsemen had been observed by some of
the scouts who had been watching Holbeche House,
and they gave the alarm to the body of men which
had collected for the purpose of either attacking or
hunting down the conspirators; the consequence was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>that Sir Everard, his page, and his servant had not
proceeded more than a few miles when they heard
shouts in the distance behind them, and on looking
round, perceived that they were being pursued by that
motley, but much-dreaded, force known as the &#8220;hue
and cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>To say nothing of the indignity of being captured
by a yelling mob, it would be infinitely more dangerous
than a voluntary submission to some recognised
authority; for this reason, Digby, with his two
attendants, tried to escape, and, as they were riding
three excellent horses, they had great hopes of succeeding
in doing so.</p>

<p>Nor were these hopes altogether groundless; for,
when they began to gallop, they soon widened the
distance between themselves and their pursuers; but
they observed that the peasants and wayfarers whom
they passed turned round to stare at them, which
showed that their route would be pointed out to the
&#8220;hue-and-cry.&#8221;As Father Gerard says, &#8220;it was not
possible for them to pass or go unknown, especially
Sir Everard Digby, being so noted a man for his
stature and personage, and withal so well appointed as
he was.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> He thought it wisest, therefore, to go into a
large wood, and to hide there until the &#8220;hue-and-cry&#8221;
should have passed. In this fortune favoured them, for,
on turning along a bye-path from the main track in the
wood, they saw a dry pit, and down into this they rode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>They had not been very long concealed in it when
they heard the distant thud of galloping horses, and
every now and then the shouting of their riders.
Nearer and nearer came the sounds, and, just as they
grew loudest, to his great delight Digby heard them
beginning to decrease in force, which showed that the
galloping mob had passed his retreat and was going
on an objectless errand.</p>

<p>Presently the sounds ceased altogether, and Sir
Everard and his two companions were on the point of
emerging from their ambush, when they fancied they
heard the footsteps of two horses proceeding at a walk.
A voice confirmed them in this opinion. Once more
there was silence, and once again there were sounds of
horses&#8217; feet and men&#8217;s voices.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry of &#8220;Here he is; here he is!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
showed that they were discovered. The baffled hunters
had turned back to try to trace the hoof-marks of the
fugitives&#8217; horses on either side of the rough roadway
through the wood, and the wet, muddy weather had
enabled them to succeed in this attempt. In that
moment of extreme peril, Sir Everard showed plenty
of courage. &#8220;Here he is, indeed!&#8221;said he; &#8220;what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw about ten or twelve horsemen
standing about the entrance to the pit; and believing
that the main body of the &#8220;hue-and-cry&#8221;were
scattered about the wood searching in different
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>directions, he hoped to be able to force his way
through the small group which he saw above;
accordingly he &#8220;advanced his horse in the manner
of curvetting (which he was expert in) and thought
to have borne them over, and so to break from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the event proved, they were quite unprepared
for the shock of his charge, and, thrown into confusion,
they were unable to prevent him from forcing
his way safely through their midst; but as soon as
he had done so, he found himself surrounded by more
than a hundred horsemen, trotting up from different
directions. Perceiving that escape was now impossible,
he &#8220;willingly yielded himself to the likeliest
man of the company,&#8221;and was immediately made
a prisoner.</p>

<p>Would it have been more becoming to have sold
his life dearly and to have died on the field by shot,
pike, or sword, than to have surrendered to that ill-mounted,
ill-armed, and irregular band of squireens,
yeomen, and tradesmen, with the certainty of the
disgraceful gallows and the quartering hatchet before
him? The reasons for his acting otherwise, given
by Father Gerard, are at least logical. He had a
desire, he says,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> &#8220;to have some time before his
death for his better preparation, and withal&#8221;he
hoped &#8220;to have done some service to the Catholic
cause by word, sith he saw he could not do it by
the sword.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>I have been unable to find any details as to what
befel Sir Everard between his arrest and his long,
wearying, and humiliating ride of nearly a hundred
and twenty miles to London. Bound a prisoner on
his horse, and guarded by armed men on all sides,
he would be an object of curiosity and derision in
every town, village, and hamlet through which he
passed. He would be taken through Warwickshire,
which had been the scene of his fruitless attempt
to raise an insurrection during the two previous
days; probably, through many places well known
in happier times in Northamptonshire; through yet
more familiar localities in Buckinghamshire, where
he had hitherto been hailed with raised hats and
genial smiles; and even, perhaps, within a few miles
of his beloved Gothurst itself. When he entered
Middlesex, the nearer he came to London, the greater
would be the angry demonstrations of hostility on
the part of the crowds that turned out to see the
traitor and conspirator as he was conducted towards
the Tower to take his trial for high treason. There
may have been a few sympathisers among the mob,
such as the man who was heard to whisper that
&#8220;It had been brave sport, yf it had gone forward&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
but such remarks would not be made loud enough
to reach the ears of Digby.</p>

<p>The shame of that journey must have been intense
to a man constituted like Sir Everard, and it may
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>have been increased by the reflection that he had
forsaken his friends, with the intention of surrendering
himself; and that, although they had certainly
deceived him, he was in some sense a deserter from
their ranks, at the moment of their extremity, as
well as a traitor to his king.</p>

<p>Unquestionably his greatest sorrow of all was to
think of his wife and children at Coughton. The
unfortunate Lady Digby had sent a servant, named
James Garvey,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> &#8220;in search of his master, when he
was apprehended&#8221;; for &#8220;Sir Everard had horses at
Coughton.&#8221;Although she would doubtless think it
a comparatively minor matter, the rude fact was soon
forced upon her that, if her husband were attainted of
high treason, all his estates would be confiscated, and
she presently learned that the lawyers were already
wrangling over the technical question whether her
own property at Gothurst, which was settled on Sir
Everard and his children, would not have to go too.
The Crown lawyers claimed that it would, and they
issued a notice that no part of it, or its revenues,
must be touched by Lady Digby, or anyone else,
until after her husband&#8217;s trial. She was, therefore,
immediately placed in a position of pecuniary embarrassment
and want.</p>

<p>Although it is an oft-told tale, and does not directly
concern the subject of my biography, my story might
seem incomplete if I were to say nothing of those
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>whom Sir Everard had left behind him, when he rode
away from Holbeche.</p>

<p>According to Jardine, two of the company at
Holbeche, besides Sir Everard, deserted that
house on the Friday morning. One was the
host, Stephen Littleton. It should be remembered
that he had not been a sworn conspirator in the
Gunpowder Plot, and that it would seem hard that
he should bear the penalty of sheltering his friends
who had been concerned in it. As a matter of fact,
this was exactly what he had to do; for he was
executed for this very offence and, curiously enough,
another too good-natured man, of the name of
Perkises, was executed in his turn for sheltering him.
The other fugitive was Robert Winter, who was
afterwards captured and executed.</p>

<p>Sir Everard and his men had not long left Holbeche,
when Catesby, Rookwood, and Grant endeavoured to
dry some of the gunpowder from Whewell, which had
got &#8220;dank&#8221;in the open cart on its journey the
previous afternoon, upon a platter over a large fire.
As might have been expected, it ignited and exploded,
severely burning several of them.</p>

<p>Even Catesby now lost heart, expressed his fears
that God disapproved of their proceedings,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and said
that here he meant to remain and die. The other
conspirators said they would do the same, and they
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>seem now, for the first time, to some extent, to have
realised the enormity of their sin. They perceived
&#8220;God to be against them; all prayed before the
picture of Our Lady, and confessed that the act was
so bloody as they desired God to forgive them.&#8221;
Then, says Father Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> &#8220;They all fell earnestly to
their prayers, the Litanies and such like (as some of
the company affirmed that escaped taking, being none
of the conspirators, but such as joined with them in
the country); they also spent an hour in meditation.&#8221;
It is satisfactory to know that they showed some
contrition for their terrible iniquity and tried to make
their peace with God; and, being Catholics, they
would know what to do to this end.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock, the High Sheriff appeared with a
large force and surrounded the house. Thomas
Winter went out into the court-yard and was shot in
the shoulder by an arrow from a cross-bow, just as
Catesby, who followed him, exclaimed, &#8220;Stand by me,
Tom, and we will die together.&#8221;The two brothers,
John and Christopher Wright, followed him, and both
were mortally wounded. Rookwood, who had been
severely burned by the explosion of gunpowder, was
shot through the arm by a bullet from a musket and
wounded in the body by a pike. Catesby and
Percy stood back to back and were both shot through
the body. Catesby died shortly afterwards in the
house, after declaring &#8220;that the plot and practice of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>this treason was only his, and that all others were
but his assistants, chosen by himself to that purpose,
and that the honour thereof belonged only to himself.&#8221;
Percy died the next day.</p>

<p>As soon as Catesby and Percy had fallen, the
attacking party rushed into the court-yard, overpowered
the feeble resistance offered to them, and
made prisoners of the whole party.</p>

<p>The besiegers of Holbeche House were little more
orderly than the hue and cry which had chased Sir
Everard Digby. Sir Thos. Lawley, who was assisting
the Sheriff of Worcestershire, wrote afterward to
Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;I hasted to revive Catesby and Percy
and the two Wrights, who lay deadly wounded on
the ground, thinking by the recovery of them to have
done unto his Majesty better service than by suffering
them to die. But such was the extreme disorder of
the baser sort, that while I with my men took up one
of the languishing traitors, the rude people stripped
the rest naked; and their wounds being many and
grievous, and no surgeon at hand, they became
incurable and so died.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very short time, Sir Everard Digby, Rookwood,
Thomas Winter, John Grant, Robert Keyes, Francis
and Tresham were all safely lodged in the Tower, besides
the earliest conspirator arrested&mdash;Guy Fawkes.</p>

<p>One of the first things that Sir Everard did after
being brought to London was to beg as a special
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>favour to be permitted to see the king<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>&mdash;a boon most
unlikely to be granted&mdash;&#8220;intending to lay down the
causes so plainly which had moved them to this attempt,&#8221;
namely the Gunpowder Plot, &#8220;and withal how
dangerous it was for His Majesty to take the course he
did, as that he hoped to persuade at least some mitigation,
if not toleration, for Catholics.&#8221;Of course he
was informed that no such favour would be shown him;
but that he would very shortly be examined by the
Lords of the Council, when an opportunity would be
given to him of making a statement.</p>

<p>The news of the popular indignation at the Gunpowder
Plot must have added greatly to Digby&#8217;s
sorrows. On Sunday, November 10th,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> &#8220;a solemn
thanksgiving was offered in all the churches.&#8221;He
would hear, too, that on the night of the very day that
the explosion was to have taken place, church-bells
were ringing, and bonfires were blazing in all directions
as a testimony of the public rejoicing at the failure of
the plot.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Even<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> &#8220;the Spanish Ambassador made
bonfires, and threw money amongst the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>More galling still was the ever-increasing evidence
of the horror of the English Catholics and their
angry disclaimers of having had anything to do with,
or any sympathy for, such a nefarious scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, after the discovery,&#8221;says Tierney,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> &#8220;the pope
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span>himself abstained from issuing a formal condemnation
of the conspiracy, Blackwell, at least, his delegate and
representative in England, instantly came forward to
stigmatize it as a &#8216;detestable device,&#8217; an &#8216;intolerable,
uncharitable, scandalous, and desperate fact.&#8217; No
sooner had the proclamation for the apprehension of
the conspirators announced the intelligence that
Catholics were implicated in it, than he addressed a
letter to the clergy and laity of his flock (Nov. 7),
reminding them of the criminality of all forcible attempts
against the government, and exhorting them
to manifest their respect for the decisions of the church,
the clergy by inculcating, the laity by practising, that
patient submission to the laws, which alone could
&#8216;please God, mollify man, and increase their merits
and their glory in the world to come.&#8217;&#8221;Reports of
this letter would be received by Sir Everard on his
arrival in London.</p>

<p>The Archpriest&#8217;s manifesto was most opportune; for
about the time he was writing it, Ben Jonson, the poet,
who had been a Catholic for seven years,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> was writing
to Salisbury that some say they must consult the Archpriest;
but that he, Ben Jonson, thinks<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> &#8220;they are all
so enweaved in it as it will make 500 gent. lesse of
the religion within this weeke.&#8221;He also got up in the
Council Chamber at Whitehall,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> denounced the plot on
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>behalf of the Catholics of England, and offered his
services in hunting down the gang of miscreants that
had brought this discredit on his Church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three weeks later,&#8221;continues Tierney, the Archpriest
&#8220;repeated his admonition in still stronger
terms. He reminded his people of his former letter,
assured them that &#8216;no violent attempt against the
king or his government could be other than a most
grievous and heinous offence to God&#8217;; and concluded
by declaring that, as the pope had already condemned
all such unlawful proceedings, so he, by the authority
of the pope, now strictly forbad Catholics, under
pain of ecclesiastical censures, &#8216;to attempt any practise
or action, tending to the prejudice&#8217; of the throne, or
to behave themselves in any manner but such &#8216;as
became dutiful subjects and religious Catholics, to
their king, his counsellors, and officers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a copy of the first of these two letters<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> before
me, I am struck by one sentence which lays down
a golden rule concerning political plots. &#8220;Moreover,
our divines do say that it is not lawful for private
subjects, by private authority, to take arms against
their lawful king, albeit he become a tyrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>How bitterly Sir Everard Digby felt the disapproval
of the Catholics may be judged from one
of his letters to his wife, written in the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> &#8220;But
now let me tell you, what a grief it hath been to me,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>to hear that so much condemned which I did believe
would have been otherwise thought on by Catholicks;
there is no other cause but this, which hath made
me desire life, for when I came into prison, death
would have been a welcome friend unto me, and was
most desired; but when I heard how Catholicks and
Priests thought of the matter, and that it should be
a great sin that should be in the <i>Cause</i> of my end,
it called my conscience in doubt of my very best
actions and intentions in question: for I knew that
my self might easily be deceived in such a business,
therefore I protest unto you that the doubts I had
of my own good state, which only proceeded from
the censure of others, caused more bitterness of grief
in me than all the miseries that ever I suffered, and
only this caused me wish life till I might meet with
a ghostly friend. For some good space I could do
nothing, but with tears ask pardon at God&#8217;s hands
for all my errors, both in actions and intentions in
this business, and in my whole life, which the censure
of this, contrary to my expectance, caused me to
doubt; I did humbly beseech that my death, might
satisfie for my offence, which I should and shall offer
most gladly to the Giver of Life. I assure you as
I hope in God that the love of all my estate and
worldly happiness did never trouble me, nor the
love of it since my imprisonment did ever move
me to wish life. But if that I may live to make
satisfaction to God and the world, where I have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
given any scandal, I shall not grieve if I should
never look Living Creature in the face again, and
besides that deprivation endure all worldly misery.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Sir Everard was examined in the Tower several
times; first, on two successive days, November 19th
and 20th, he was questioned at some length, before
Nottingham, Suffolk, Devonshire, Northampton, Salisbury,
Mar, Dunbar, and Coke. A good deal of his
evidence has already been quoted. On the first day,
he only admitted that Catesby<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> &#8220;did comfort him
with future hopes and told him that he doubted not
but there would be a course effected for theyr good,&#8221;
and that it was not until Tuesday, the 5th of November,
that &#8220;Mr Catesbie acquainted him with the practice
of y<sup>e</sup> treason of y<sup>e</sup> blowing up the Parlam<sup>t</sup>. howse,&#8221;
when he &#8220;gave him some inkling what had bin the
plott of undermining the Parlament howse, to blow
it up; and on Wednesday told him more at large
&amp;c.,&#8221;naming &#8220;who had bin the miners.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following day, however, &#8220;he beinge shewed
by the L<sup>s</sup> his follye and faulte in denyinge that w<sup>ch</sup>
was so manyfest and beinge toulde that both Tho.
Wynter had speach w<sup>h</sup> him of the pticulars, concerninge
the plot of the powder to blow upp the K.
in the Parliament house, and being confronted w<sup>th</sup>
Mr Faucks who charged him to have discoursed w<sup>th</sup>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>him thereof abowte a weeke before the 5th of
November at his house in Buck.shyer,&#8221;he confessed
more freely. Fawkes had been tortured,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and most
likely, when he charged Sir Everard in this way,
he did it in order to escape being tortured again.
So many of the conspirators were now known by
the others to be in the Tower, and each was so much
afraid of what the others might have confessed, that
they became terrified and confessed freely when examined.
Neither of them knew which of his companions
had been tortured in order to induce him to
incriminate his friends; and each feared that he
might, at any moment, be himself laid upon the
rack.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>Sir Everard says, in a letter from the Tower,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> that,
at one of his examinations, &#8220;they did in a Fashion
offer me the torture, which I wil rather indure then
hurt any body&#8221;; but it was only a threat; for, although
torture was used to priests and Jesuits in
connection with the Gunpowder Plot, it does not<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
appear to have been brought to bear upon any of
the actual conspirators except Guy Fawkes. Lord
Dunfermline, however, strongly urged Salisbury to
expose them to it.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> &#8220;Recommends that the prisoners
be confined apart, in darkness, and examined by
torch-light, and that the tortures be slow and at
intervals, as being the most effectual.&#8221;On the
other hand, a tract, printed in 1606,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> says of the
conspirators, that &#8220;in the time of their imprison<span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>ment,
they rather feasted with their sins, than fasted
with sorrow for them; were richly apparelled, fared
deliciously, and took tobacco out of measure, with
a seeming carelessness of their crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard had not been many days in the Tower
before the Government had a search made at Harrowden,
the house of his young friend, Lord Vaux,
whose mother was suspected of having been privy
to the plot. Great hopes were entertained of finding
here Digby&#8217;s great friend, Father Gerard, who also
lay under suspicion of having been concerned in
it.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> &#8220;The house was beset with at least 300 men,
and those well appointed.&#8221;&#8220;They searched for two
or three days continually, and searched with candles
in cellars and several dark corners. They searched
every cabinet and box in her [Mrs Vaux&#8217;s] own
closet, for letters, &amp;c.&#8221;A letter to Salisbury stated<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
that Mrs Vaux &#8220;gave up all her keys; all the
rooms, especially his closet, narrowly searched, but
no papers found. She and the young Lord strongly
deny all knowledge of the treason; the house still
guarded.&#8221;Brother Foley says<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> &#8220;that house was
strictly searched and watched for nine days, with
the especial hope of seizing Father Gerard. Though
he escaped, the pious lady of the house was herself
carried off to London.&#8221;She was severely examined
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>before the Privy Council; and Sir Everard Digby
was pressed to say whether he had not been very
lately in her company&mdash;indeed, it was on this point
that &#8220;they did in a Fashion offer&#8221;him &#8220;the
torture&#8221;&mdash;but, although she admitted, in her examination,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
that Sir Everard Digby, Robert Catesby,
and &#8220;Greene and Darcy, priests,&#8221;had been visitors
at her house, and, when she refused to say where
Father Gerard was, she was told she must die,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
nothing could be proved against her and she was
liberated.</p>

<p>It must have been a great comfort to Lady Digby
to receive the scraps of paper inscribed with lemon
juice from her husband. It is easy to imagine the
eagerness and care with which she would hold them
before the fire in order to develope their writing,
with anxiety to make every letter legible and fear
lest the paper should become scorched. Sir Everard
calls her his &#8220;Dearest&#8221;; but, in letters which might
possibly fall into hands for which they were not
intended, it would have been out of place to make
much display of affection, and the only exhibition
of that kind is to be found in a poem which will be
quoted later.</p>

<p>In her straits for money, she applied, and not
altogether without success, to Salisbury; for we find
her writing to him thus:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

postscript.</p>

<p>Lady Digby did not find Lord Salisbury&#8217;s orders for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>
her relief so availing in practice as in theory; for, a little
later, she wrote to him again. I will not weary my
readers by giving her exact spelling&mdash;such words as

&#8220;reseved,&#8221;for received, and &#8220;howsold&#8221;for household,
soon become troublesome and vexatious&mdash;but I will
endeavour to transcribe her letter according to modern
orthography and punctuation.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> &#8220;<span class="smcap">Mary Digby to Lord Salisbury.</span>
</p>

<p>Right Honourable Lord.&mdash;My poor and perplexed
estate enforceth me to be an humble petitioner to
your good Lordship. I was most fearful and loth to
trouble your honour so long as I had any hopes of
redress without it; but finding none elsewhere, makes
me presume to present these unto your honour. I
confidently believe your lordship doth think that, upon
yours with others of the Lords of his majesty &mdash;&mdash; council,
your letters to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire
in my behalf (for which I humbly give thanks),
hath given ease and relief unto my present wants;
but truly my lord it is nothing so, for all which he
hath done, since he received that letter, is but that he
hath returned, near from whence he had taken, part
of the household stuff which he had carried away and
there keepeth it; but will not let anything be delivered
to my use; notwithstanding I procured the
Lord Treasurer&#8217;s warrant to him, for the delivery of
divers things most needful for my present use; for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
which I was to put in sureties for their return, when
they should be justly demanded, which was by bond
and drawn according to the Lord Treasurer his own
direction, which was, as the sheriff said, too favourable
for me, and therefore did refuse it; such strange and
hard proceedings doth he still continue against me
(the particulars thereof were too tedious to relate unto
your lordship) that, without your honour&#8217;s good
assistance, I shall receive no part of such good favours
as your lordship meant unto me. Never, since my
grievous calamities, I have received no one penny,
but am forced to borrow, both for my own present
spending, and to furnish Mr Digby with those things
he wants, and as hath been called to me for by the
lieutenant of the Tower, which borrowed money I
must forthwith repay; and the cause why I can
receive none, according to the allowance which was
granted for me, is because this sheriff will not pay the
money into the exchequer which he hath received for
such goods which he sold of Mr Digby&#8217;s, which is
between 200 and 300 pounds, and hath said he would
keep it in his hands till he were allowed for the charge
he was at, for the carrying the goods&#8221;[some words
here are mutilated] &#8220;and bringing of them back
again. My hope in your Lordship&#8217;s pity to my
distress promiseth me to find relief for these my complaints,
for which I will ever remain your honour&#8217;s
most thankful&mdash;</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mary Digby.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>&#8220;<i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;Right honourable,&mdash;Though it be no
part of my letter, yet is it a very far greater part of
my humble desire to your Lordship whereby, I cannot
but beg your pitiful commiseration to incline and
further his majesty&#8217;s mercy for my woeful husband,
which if your Lordship extend such a charitable act, we
and all what is ours will ever be your honour&#8217;s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The &#8220;goods which he sold of Mr Digby&#8217;s,&#8221;mentioned
in the letter may be assumed to have been
the contents of the trunk, carried by his &#8220;trunk-horse,&#8221;
and inventoried in a letter<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> written from the
Tower.</p>

<p>It is probable that Lady Digby wrote to her
husband, expressing herself powerless to &#8220;conceive
his nature to give consent for such an act&#8221;as the
Gunpowder Plot; for he wrote to her from the Tower
excusing himself.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you, that if I had thought there had
been the least sin in the Plot, I would not have been
of it for all the world: and no other cause drew me to
hazard my Fortune and Life, but zeal to God&#8217;s
Religion. For my keeping it secret, it was caused by
certain belief, that those which were best able to judge
of the lawfulness of it,&#8221;&mdash;by these he evidently means
the Jesuit Fathers&mdash;&#8220;had been acquainted with it,
and given way to it. More reasons I had to persuade
me to this belief than I dare utter, which I will never,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>to the suspicion of any, though I should go to the Rack
for it, and as I did not know it directly that it was
approved by such so did I hold it in my Conscience
the best not to know any more if I might.&#8221;He seems
to have intended to convey that he had been practically
certain that the Jesuit Fathers had given their approval
but was anxious to be able to say that he did not
actually know this.</p>

<p>In another letter,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> he says &#8220;My dearest, the &mdash;&mdash; I
take at the uncharitable taking of these
matters, will make me say more than I ever thought
to have done. For if this design had taken place,
there could have been no doubt of other Success: for
that night, before any other could have brought the
news, we should have known it by Mr Catesby, who
should have proclaimed the Heir-Apparent at Charing-Cross,
as he came out of Town; to which purpose there
was a Proclamation Drawn,&#8221;etc. The absurdity of
attaching any value to a proclamation by such a
comparatively insignificant individual as Catesby does
not appear to have occurred to him!</p>

<p>After describing the plans laid for securing the young
Duke and the Princess Elizabeth, he goes on to say
&#8220;there were also courses taken for the satisfying of the
people if the first had taken effect, as the speedy notice
of Liberty and Freedom from all manner of Slavery,
as the ceasing of Wardships and all Monopolies,
which with change would have been more plausible to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>the people, if the first had been, than is now. There
was also a course taken to have given present notice
to all Princes, and to <i>Associate</i> them with an Oath
answerable to the League in France.&#8221;Whether &#8220;all
Princes&#8221;would have felt inclined &#8220;to associate&#8221;
themselves &#8220;with an Oath&#8221;at the request of a band
of assassins may be questioned.</p>

<p>Sir Everard, as well as Lady Digby, wrote to Salisbury;
but his letters asked for fewer favours.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your Lordship,&#8221;he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> &#8220;and the State think
it fit to deal severely with the Catholics, within brief
there will be massacres, rebellions, and desperate attempts
against the King and State. For it is a general
received reason among Catholics, that there is not that
expecting and suffering course now to be run that was
in the Queen&#8217;s time, who was the last of her line, and
last in expectance to run violent courses against
Catholics; for then it was hoped that the King that
now is, would have been at least free from persecuting,
as his promise was before coming into this realm, and
as divers his promises have been since his coming.
All these promises every man sees broken.&#8221;At the
same time, he said that he<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> &#8220;will undertake to secure
the Pope&#8217;s promise not to excommunicate the King,
if he will deal mildly with Catholics.&#8221;As to plots
against the king and the government, something of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>kind, he declares, would have been contrived sooner,
if the priests had not hindered it.</p>

<p>An earlier letter written by him from the Tower,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> is
thus summarized:&mdash;&#8220;Sir Everard Digby to Salisbury.
Is willing to tell all he knows, but can remember
nothing more than he has already confessed, except that
Catesby intended to send the Earls of Westmoreland
and Derby to raise forces in the North, and would
send information to France, Spain, Italy, etc., of their
success. Begs that the King will have compassion
on his family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile examinations were constantly going on,
not only of the prisoners in the Tower, but also of other
persons, with regard to the Gunpowder Plot, and the
correspondence on the subject was very large. Lord
Salisbury wrote to the Lord Chancellor of Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
assuring him that he &#8220;would rather die than be slack
in searching the dregs of&#8221;the plot &#8220;to the bottom.&#8221;
Lady Markham wrote to Salisbury, that<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> the &#8220;Plot
hath taken deep and dangerous root&#8221;; that many will
not believe &#8220;that holy and good man,&#8221;Father Gerard,
had anything to do with it; and that Sir Everard
Digby is the man from whom he must endeavour to
obtain particulars about Walley&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Father Garnet.
Mrs Vaux was examined on the eighteenth of November,
and she made no secret of Sir Everard having been a
visitor at her house. Lady Lovel admitted knowing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>both Sir Everard and Catesby, though slightly. To
have been a friend of Digby&#8217;s was now very dangerous.
Servants and retainers of the conspirators
were arrested in Worcestershire and Warwickshire,
and there examined.</p>

<p>Sir Everard must have envied Tresham his fate, when
he heard that he had died in the Tower, especially as
he was allowed to have his wife to attend him in his
illness; although his death was caused by a painful
disease.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Sir William Waad, the Lieutenant of the
Tower, had a consultation of three doctors&mdash;not from
motives of mercy, but in order that, &#8220;by great care
and good providence,&#8221;he might &#8220;die of that kind of
death he most&#8221;deserved, and, in spite of his disappointment,
Waad seems to have felt a grain of satisfaction,
when writing to Salisbury to announce his death,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> in
stating that he died &#8220;with very great pain.&#8221;His
death took place only four days before that appointed
for the trial, and, whatever may have been his sufferings,
who can doubt that Sir Everard would gladly
have changed places with him.</p>

<p>In his solitude in the Tower, Sir Everard wrote the
following lines which, if considerably lacking in merit
from a poetical and critical point of view, have some
interest on account of their pitiful, though calm and
dignified tone, as well as the affection which they
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>exhibit towards his wife and his children; and, as the
Protestant Bishop Barlow, in his preface to their publication
in 1678, says, &#8220;though they be not excellent,
yet have&#8221;they &#8220;a good tincture of Piety and devotion
in them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>The trial of the prisoners was long delayed; quite
ten weeks passed between their capture and their
sentence; but, as Mr Hepworth Dixon puts it,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> they
were, in fact, &#8220;undergoing a course of daily trial by
Northampton in the Tower.&#8221;In the so-called gunpowder
plot room, in the Lieutenant&#8217;s House, with
its panelled walls, and high, wide window, they
underwent &#8220;a thousand interrogatories from Coke,
a thousand hostilities from Waad, and a thousand
treacheries from Forsett. This Forsett was one of
Northampton&#8217;s spies; a useful and despicable wretch,
whom his master employed in overhearing and reporting
the private conversations of prisoners with each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coke himself, in his speech at the trial, referred
to the long delay in bringing the prisoners to the bar,
saying<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> &#8220;There have been already twenty and three

the good results of the delay thus<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;<i>Veritas
Temporis filia</i>, Truth is the daughter of
Time, especially in this case; wherein by timely and
often Examinations, First, matters of greatest moment
have been lately found out. Secondly, some known
Offenders, and those capital, but lately apprehended.
Thirdly, sundry of the principal and Arch-traytors
before unknown, now manifested, as the Jesuits.
Fourthly&mdash;&#8221;but he might have abridged this statement
into these few words&mdash;We hoped to worm some
evidence out of the prisoners against Catholic priests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>Sir Everard appears to have received several kind
communications, whilst in the Tower, from Father
Gerard, if we may judge from some of his remarks
concerning &#8220;my brother&#8221;in his letters to Lady
Digby.</p>

<p>For instance, we find him writing<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;Let my
Brother see this, or know its Contents, tell him I
love his sweet comforts as my greatest Jewel in this
Place&#8221;; in another,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> &#8220;I give my Brother many thanks
for his sweet comforts, and assure him that now I
desire death; for the more I think on God&#8217;s mercy
the more I hope in my own case: though others
have censured our Intentions otherwise than I understood
them to be, and though the Act be thought
so wicked by those of Judgment, yet I hope that
my understanding it otherwise, with my Sorrow
for my Error, will find acceptance at God&#8217;s hands.&#8221;
In another he sends a warning to him,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> &#8220;Howsoever
my Brother is informed, I am sure they fear him
for knowledge of the Plot, for at every examination
I am told that he did give the Sacrament to five at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>one time.&#8221;And once again,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> he says:&mdash;&#8220;Tell my
Brother I do honour him as befits me, but I did not
think I could have increased so much, loving him
more as his charitable Lessons <i>would</i> make me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But if Father Gerard had sent very consoling
messages to Sir Everard in his imprisonment; on
one occasion&mdash;it was within a few days of the trial&mdash;he
wrote him a formal letter, which he sent to Lord
Salisbury and the Duke of Lenox, asking them to
give it to Sir Everard and hear what he might say
in answer to it. To Salisbury himself he wrote
another letter, in the course of which he said<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;Sir
Everard Digby can testify for me, how ignorant
I was of any such matter&#8221;[as the Gunpowder Plot],
&#8220;but two days before that unnatural parricide should
have been practised. I have, for full trial thereof,
enclosed a letter unto him, which I humbly beseech
may be delivered, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time he wrote to the Duke of Lenox,
&#8220;My humble petition therefore is, that a witness
be asked his knowledge who is well able to clear me
if he will, and I hope he will not be so unjust in
this time of his own danger as to conceal so needful
a proof being so demanded of him. Sir Everard
Digby doth well know how far I was from knowledge
of any such matter but two days before the treason
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>was known to all men. I have therefore written a
letter unto him, to require his testimony of that
which passed between him and me at that time.
Wherein, if I may have your lordship&#8217;s furtherance
to have just trial made of the truth whilst yet he
liveth, I shall ever esteem myself most deeply bound,
&amp;c., &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>This letter to Sir Everard, which, of course, would
be read first by Salisbury and Lenox, began:&mdash;&#8220;Sir
Everard Digby,&mdash;I presume so much of your sincerity
both to God and man, that I cannot fear you will
be loath to utter your knowledge for the clearing of
one that is innocent from a most unjust accusation
importing both loss of life to him that is accused, and
of good name also, which he much more esteemeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he says that upon some false information,
given, he supposes, &#8220;by some base fellows, desirous
to save their lives by the loss of their honesty,&#8221;&mdash;this
looks as if he suspected some of the conspirators in
the Gunpowder Plot, imprisoned in the Tower&mdash;a
&#8220;proclamation has been issued against myself and my
superior&#8221;&mdash;this would be Father Garnet&mdash;&#8220;and one
other of the Society,&#8221;probably Father Oldcorne, &#8220;as
against three notorious practisers, with divers of the
principal conspirators in this late most odious treason
of destroying the King&#8217;s Majesty and all in the
Parliament House with powder. And myself am
put in the first place, as the first or chiefest offender
therein.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>He calls God to witness that he knew nothing of
the plot until it became known publicly; but, he
says, &#8220;to give more full proof of my innocency to
those who also may doubt my words, I take witness
to yourself whether you, upon your certain knowledge
cannot clear me.&#8221;At first he would not appeal to Sir
Everard because, as he says, &#8220;I would not take
knowledge of any personal acquaintance with you,
especially at your own house, not knowing how far
you were to be vouched for your life, and therefore
would not add unto your danger,&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, by showing
that he knew and had harboured a priest. &#8220;But
now that it appears by your confession and trial in
the country that you stand at the King&#8217;s mercy for
greater matters than your acquaintance with a Priest,
I hope you will not be loath, I should publish that
which cannot hurt you, and may help myself in a
matter of such importance. And as I know you
could never like to stoop to so base and unworthy
a humour as to flatter or dissemble with any man,
so much less can I fear that now (being in the case
you are in) you can ever think it fit to dissemble
with God, or not to utter your every knowledge,
being required as from him, and in behalf of truth.
Therefore I desire you will bear witness of the truth
which followeth (if it be true that I affirm of my
demand to you, growing upon my ignorance in the
matter then in hand) as you expect truth and mercy
at God&#8217;s hand hereafter. First, I desire you to bear<span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>
witness, whether, coming to your house upon All
Souls&#8217; Day last&mdash;&#8221;and then he questions him upon
the details, described in a former chapter, of what
took place at Gothurst upon All Souls&#8217; Day, which
are mainly taken from this letter.</p>

<p>He ends by saying, &#8220;And thus clear I was from the
knowledge of that Plot against the Parliament House,
whereof, notwithstanding, I am accused and proclaimed
to be a practiser with the principal conspirators. But
I refer me to God and your conscience, who are able
to clear me, and I challenge the conscience of any one
that certainly expecteth death, and desireth to die in
the fear of God and with hope of His salvation, to
accuse me of it if he can. God, of His mercy, grant
unto us all grace to see and do His will, and to live
and die His servants, for they only are and shall be
happy for ever.&mdash;Your companion in tribulation
though not in the cause,</p>

<p class="quotsig">
<span class="smcap">John Gerard.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering the bosom friendship that existed
between Gerard and Digby, and the high opinion of
the honourable character expressed, in his writings, by
the former of the latter, these tremendous exhortations
to speak the truth in his favour look a little superfluous.
They may have been intended rather for the
eyes of Salisbury and Lennox than for those of Digby;
for anything which could show an excessive familiarity
between Digby and Gerard might have been suspicious
evidence against the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>There is a postscript, again, which seems written as
a suggestion for what Digby should say. &#8220;I hope
you will also witness with me that you have ever
seen me much averted from such violent courses, and
hopeful rather of help by favour than force. And,
indeed, if I had not now been satisfied by your
assurance that there was nothing in hand, it should
presently have appeared how much I had misliked any
forcible attempts, the counsel of Christ and the commandment
of our superiors requiring the contrary, and
that in patience we should possess our souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>To give him his due, Sir Everard Digby spoke boldly
in Father Gerard&#8217;s favour at his trial. Five-and-twenty
years later, Father Gerard wrote, in a letter to Dr
Smith, Bishop of Chalcedon,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> &#8220;Sir Everard Digby,
who of all the others, for many reasons, was most
suspected of having possibly revealed the secret to me,
protested in open Court and declared that he had
often been instigated to say I knew something of the
Plot, but that he had always answered in the negative,
alleging the reason why he had never disclosed it to
me, because, he said, he feared lest I should dissuade
him from it. Therefore the greater part of the Privy
Councillors considered my innocence established, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>Six months later, Father Fitzherbert, Rector of the
English College of Rome, wrote concerning Father
Gerard to the same bishop<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> &#8220;he was fully cleared of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>it&#8221;[the Gunpowder Plot] &#8220;by the public and solemn
testimony of the delinquents themselves, namely, of
Sir Everard Digby (with whom he was known to be
most familiar and confident), who publicly protested
at his arraignment that he did never acquaint him
with their design, being assured that he would not
like of it, but dissuade him from it; and of this I can
show good testimony by letters from London written
hither at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably owing, in the main, to Sir Everard&#8217;s
declarations of his innocence, Father Gerard was
allowed to escape from England, and he survived the
Gunpowder Plot thirty-one years. It must not be
supposed, however, that he had never suffered for the
faith in this country; for he had been terribly tortured,
some years before the Gunpowder Plot, in the
Tower, from which he escaped.</p>

<p>Topcliffe&#8217;s description<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> of &#8220;Jhon Gerrarde y<sup>e</sup>
Jhezew<sup>t</sup> preest that escaip out of the Tower&#8221;may be
worthy of a passing notice. &#8220;Of a good stature sum what

falteringe or Lispinge or dooblinge of his Tonge in
his speeche.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the very day that Father Gerard&#8217;s letter for Sir
Everard Digby seems to have been delivered to Lord
Salisbury, January 23rd, Sir Everard himself wrote
a long letter to his two little sons, the eldest of which
was not yet three years old. The writing of it must
have caused him much pain; probably, also, many
tears. The most remarkable thing about it is that he
does not enter upon the question of the cause of his
death. As his sons would certainly hear of the
manner and reason of it, it might have been well to
have spoken plainly on the subject. Nevertheless,
there is something dignified in his assumption of the
position of a parent, in giving good advice to his
children, without recounting those personal faults and
follies, which he might, perhaps, consider it no part
of the duty of a father to confess to his sons.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="xlarge">&#10016;</span></p>

<blockquote><p class="p2">&#8220;<span class="smcap"><b>Jesus Maria.</b></span><a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
</p>

<p>&#8220;There be many reasons (my dear children) that
might disswade me from putting Pen to Paper in
this Kind, and onely one which urgeth me to
undertake this poor and fruitless pains. Wherefore
to tell you what inciteth me to it, is my want of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>other means to shew my Fatherly affection to each
of you (which is so far from uttering, as my mind
is willing to accept of poor means, rather than none
to bewray my disposition) if I would have been
checked from the performance of these lines, by
number and probabilities of reasons; I might then
have called to mind the unlikelihood, that these
would ever have come to your view; with the
malice of the world to me, which (I do imagine)
will not fail to endeavour to possess you with a
loathness to hear of anything that comes from me:
as also I might, and do think, on my own disability
in advising, with many other disswasive reasons,
which my former recited single stirrer-up hath
banished. Wherefore to begin with both and each
of you, I send you by these my Fatherly and last
blessing; which I have not failed to ask at God&#8217;s
hands on my knees, that he will grant to descend
so effectually on you (that his holy grace accompanying
it) it may work in you the performance
(on your part) of God&#8217;s sweet and just commandments
and on his part to you, the Guerdon that
his mercy inricheth his servants with all. Let this
end (God&#8217;s service I mean) be the chief and onely
contentious strife between you, which with all
vehemency and desire each of you may strive to
attain soonest. Let this be the mark which your
thoughts and actions may still level at; for here
is the chiefest Prise, to recompense the best de<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>server.
Believe me in this (my Sons) that though
my unripe years afford me not general experience,
yet my variety of courses in the world (and God&#8217;s
grace to illumine me) may sufficiently warrant the
verity of this principle. If you make this your
chief business (as you ought to do, and for which
end onely you were sent into the world) I doubt
not but God will send you better means for your
particular directions, than either the brevity of a
Letter or my ability can discharge. So that in
this I will say no more, but pray that you may
live as I hope to die, which is in the perfect
obedience of the Catholick and onely saving
Church.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot but a little touch, what I could wish you
did, and I hope will do to all sorts of people; it is
a lesson I could never learn well my self, but perhaps
see more what is convenient for others, than that I
were ever able to shew the force of wholesome counsel
and good instructions in my own life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Above all things in the world, seek to obey and
follow your Mother&#8217;s will and pleasure; who as she
hath been the best wife to me that ever man enjoyed,
so can she not fail to shew her self equal to the best
Mother, if you deserve not the contrary. If it please
God to send her life (though you have nothing else),
I shall leave you enough: and on the contrary, if I
could leave you ten times more than my self ever
had, yet she being taken from you, I should think<span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>
you but poor. It is not (my Sons) abundance of
riches that makes a man happy but a virtuous life;
and as they are blessings from God, and cause of
happiness to a man that useth them well, so are they
cause of misery to most men even in this world.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may read of divers men, who whiles they
lived in private state, deserved the fame of all that
knew them; but so soon as prosperous fortune, and
higher degrees, had taken possession of them, they
seemed not to be the same men, but grew into scorn
of all the world. For example <i>Galba</i> whiles he lived
in <i>Spain</i> as a private man, and, as it were, banished
his Countrey, by a Charge that procured in him great
pains and care; he was so well liked, that upon the
death of <i>Nero</i> the Emperor, he was Elected in his
room but was no sooner in that Place, than he was
plucked out of it again by violent death, as a man
unfit for such a Charge, by reason of his alteration
which that Dignity wrought in him. You may see
also in <i>Otho</i> who succeeded him, that all the while
of his prosperity, he lived a most dissolute life and
odious to all men; but he was no sooner touched
with adversity, but he grew to a brave and worthy
resolution, making choice rather (not out of desperation)
of his own death, than that by his life the
Common-weal should be disturbed. And though I
cannot but disallow the manner of his death (by
reason he knew not God truly) yet is it plain, that
adversity brought him to that worthy mind, which<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
contemned life in regard of his Countrey&#8217;s good; and
which was so contrary to that mind that prosperity
had misled in him. If then adverse Fortune were
so powerful more than prosperity on Pagans and
Misbelievers, to procure in them worthy minds;
what may we expect the force of it should be in
Christians, whose first Captain (not out of necessity,
but free choice) made manifest to the world, by his
own painful foot steps that there is no other perfect
and certain way to true happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He hath not onely staid here in demonstration of
his verity, but hath sent to all those (who, the world
knows, he highliest esteemed, and best loved) nothing
but variety of misery in this life, with cruel and
forced death; the which thing truest wisdom esteems
as the best tokens of Love from so powerful a Sender,
and as the best and certainest way to bring a man
to perfect happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak not this to conclude, that no man is happy
but those which run this strict and best course. But
to tell you (my Children) that if the world seek and
prevail to cut you off from enjoying my Estate and
Patrimony in this world, yet you should not think
your selves more unhappy therein: for God, it may
be, doth see, that there is some other course more fit
for you; or that this would give great hazard to your
Soul&#8217;s health, which he taketh away, by removing
the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, howsoever you find your selves in fortunes of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>
this world, use them to God&#8217;s best pleasure, and
think yourselves but Bailiffs of such things for an
uncertain time. If they be few or poor, your fear
of making a good accompt may be the lesser; and
know, that God can send more and richer, if it be
requisite for his glory and your good; if they be
many or great, so much the more care you ought
to take in governing your selves, lest God, as holding
you unworthy such a charge, by taking them from
you, or you from them, do also punish you with
eternal misery for abusing his benefits. You shall
the better learn to make true use and reckoning of
these vanities, if with due obedience you do hearken
to your mother&#8217;s wholesome counsel; and what want
you shall find in my instructions, you may see better
declared to you by looking on her life, which though
I cannot give assurance for any thing to be done in
future times yet can I not but very stedfastly believe,
that the same Lord will give perseverance in
virtue, where he hath laid so strong a foundation
for his spiritual building, and where there is such
an humble and resigned will to the pleasure of her
Lord and Maker.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next part of my charge shall be, in your
mutual carriage the one to the other; in which, all
reasons to move you to perfect accord, and entire
love, do present themselves unto you, as the obligation
of Christianity, the tie of natural and nearest
consanguinity, and the equality, or very small<span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>
difference of Age. There is in none of these any
thing wanting, that may be an impediment to truest
Friendship, nor anything to be added to them (for
procuring your mutual and heartiest love) but your
own consent and particular desert each to other.
Since then there is all cause in each of you for
this love, do not deprive yourselves of that earthly
happiness, which God, Nature, and Time offereth unto
you; but if you think that the benefit which accord
and friendship bringeth, be not sufficient to enkindle
this love (which God forbid you should) yet let
the consideration of the misery which the contrary
worketh in all degrees, stay your mind from dislike.</p>

<p>As no man in any Age, but may see great happiness
to have been attained by good agreement of Friends,
Kinsmen, and Brethren; so wanteth there not too
many examples of such, as by hate and dis-cord have
frustrated strong hopes sowed in peace, and brought
to nothing great Fortunes; besides the incurring
God&#8217;s displeasure, which still comes accompanied
with perpetual misery. If you look into Divine
Writ, you shall find, that this was the cause of
&#8216;;<i>Abel</i>&#8217;;  and &#8216;;<i>Cain&#8217;s</i>&#8217;;  misery, which the least hard
hap that came to either of them, was to be murdered
by his Brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you look into Humane Stories, you need search
no further to behold a most pitiful object than the two
sons of &#8216;Phillip,&#8217; king of &#8216;Macedon,&#8217; whose dislike
each to other was so deeply rooted, that at length it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>
burst forth to open complaints, the one of the other to
good old &#8216;Phillip&#8217; who seeing it, could not be put off
from a publick hearing, called both his sons (Demetrius
and Perseus) and in both their hearing made a most
effectual speech of concord unto them; but finding
that it would not take effect, gave them free leave to
wound his heart with their unnatural accusations, the
one against the other; which staid not there, by the
unjust hastning of their Father&#8217;s sudden death, but
caused the murther of one of them, with the utter
overthrow of that commonwealth, and the misery of
the survivor. These things (I hope) will not be so
necessary for your use, as they are hurtless to know,
and effectual where need requires.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides these examples, and fore-recited obligations,
let me joyn a Father&#8217;s charge which ought not to be
lightly esteemed in so just a cause. Let me tell you
my son <i>Kenelm</i>, that you ought to be both a Father
and a Brother to your unprovided for Brother, and
think, that what I am hindred from performing to
him by short life, and voluntary tie of my Land to
you; so much account your self bound to do him, both
in Brotherly affection to him, and in natural duty to
me. And you, my son <i>John</i>, know I send you as
Fatherly a Blessing, as if I had also given you a great
Patrimony; and that if my life had permitted, I would
have done my endeavour that way. If you find anything
in that kind to come from your Brother, take it
the more thankfully; but if that you do not, let it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>
not lessen your love to him, who ought not to be loved
by you for his Fortune or Bounty, but for himself. I
am sorry that I am cut off by time from saying so
much as I did intend at the first; but since I may
not, I will commend in my Prayers your instruction
and guidance to the Giver of all goodness, who ever
bless and keep you.&mdash;Your affectionate Father,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>On Monday, the 27th of January 1606, Sir
Everard Digby, Robert and Thomas Winter, Guy
Fawkes, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert
Keyes, and Thomas Bates, were taken from their
cells in the Tower, led to a barge, and conveyed
up the river to Westminster to be put on their trial
in the celebrated hall, which stands on the site of
the banquetting room of William Rufus. They were
to stand before their accusers on soil already famous,
and destined to become yet more famous for important
trials. Here, three hundred years earlier,
Sir William Wallace had been condemned to death.
Here, only about eighty years before their own time
came, both Anne Boleyn and Sir Thomas More had
been tried and sentenced. In this splendid building,
Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, and King Charles the
First were destined to be condemned to the block.
In the following century, sentence of death was here
to be passed upon the rebel lords of 1745; here
too, still later, Warren Hastings and Lord Melville
were to be impeached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>Sir Everard Digby and his fellow-prisoners reached
Westminster about half-an-hour before the time fixed
for the trial, and they were taken to the Star
Chamber to await the arrival of their judges. The
following is a contemporary account of their appearance
and behaviour while there.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>&#8220;It was strange to note their carriage, even in
their very countenances: some hanging down the
head, as if their hearts were full of doggedness, and
others forcing a stern look, as if they would fear&#8221;
[&#8220;that is <i>frighten</i>. <i>Footnote.</i>&#8221;] &#8220;death with a
frown, never seeming to pray, except it were by the
dozen upon their beads, and taking tobacco, as if
hanging were no trouble to them; saying nothing
but in commendation of their conceited religion,
craving mercy of neither God nor the king for their
offences, and making their consciences, as it were,
as wide as the world; and to the very gates of hell,
to be the cause of their hellish courses, to make a
work meritorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>This writer clearly did not go to the trial prepared
to be pleased with the prisoners. If they looked
down, they were &#8220;dogged&#8221;and ought to have been
looking up; if they looked up, they were &#8220;forcing
a stern look,&#8221;and ought to have been looking down:
if they were not praying, they should have been
praying, and if they were praying, yea, even praying
&#8220;by the dozen,&#8221;they should have not have been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>praying; if they smoked, it was because they did
not mind being hanged; if they talked of nothing
but religion, it was because they did not desire
God&#8217;s mercy, and one thing was certain&mdash;that their
prayers and their religion and all things about them,
to their very consciences, were &#8220;hellish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir John Harrington was another unadmiring
spectator.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>&#8220;I have seen some of the chief&#8221;[conspirators],
he says, &#8220;and think they bear an evil mark in their
foreheads, for more terrible countenances never were
looked upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another writer takes a different view, at any rate
in the case of Sir Everard Digby. As that prisoner
was being brought up for trial, says Father Gerard,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
&#8220;(not in the best case to make show of himself as
you may imagine), yet some of the chiefest in the
Court seeing him out of a window brought in that
manner, lamented him much, and said he was the
goodliest man in the whole Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>On entering Westminster Hall, the prisoners were
made to ascend a scaffold placed in front of the
judges. The Queen and the Prince were seated in
a concealed chamber from which they could see, but
could not be seen; and it was reported that the
King also was somewhere present.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The crowd was
enormous. Although a special part of the hall had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>been assigned to members of parliament who might
wish to attend the trial, they were so<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> &#8220;pestered with
others not of the House,&#8221;that one member complained,
and a committee was afterwards appointed
to enquire into the matter.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was arraigned under a separate
indictment from that of the other prisoners, and he
was tried by himself after them; but he stood by
them throughout the trial. The first indictment was
very long. After a much spun-out preamble, it stated
that the prisoners &#8220;traiterously<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> among themselves
did conclude and agree, with Gunpowder, as it
were with one blast, suddenly, traiterously, and
barbarously to blow up and tear in pieces our said
Sovereign Lord the King, the Excellent, Virtuous,
and gracious Queen Anne his dearest Wife, the most
Noble Prince Henry their Eldest Son, the future Hope
and Joy of England, and the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal; the Reverend Judges of the Realm, the
Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of Parliament, and
divers other faithful Subjects and Servants of the
King in the said Parliament,&#8221;&amp;c., &#8220;and all of them,
without any respect of Majesty, Dignity, Degree,
Sex, Age, or Place, most barbarously, and more than
beastly, traiterously and suddenly, to destroy and
swallow up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>The prisoners under this indictment pleaded &#8220;<i>Not
Guilty</i>; and put themselves upon God and the
Country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Edward Philips, Sergeant at Law, then got
upon his legs. The matter before the Court, he said,
was one of Treason;<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> &#8220;but of such horrour, and
monstrous nature, that before now,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0">The Tongue of Man never delivered,</span>
<span class="i0">The Ear of Man never heard,</span>
<span class="i0">The Heart of Man never conceited,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the Malice of Hellish or Earthly Devil never practised.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>And, if it were &#8220;abominable to murder the least,&#8221;
and if &#8220;to touch God&#8217;s annointed,&#8221; were to oppose
God himself, &#8220;Then how much more than too
monstrous&#8221; was it &#8220;to murder and subvert</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i3">Such a King,</span>
<span class="i3">Such a Queen,</span>
<span class="i3">Such a Prince,</span>
<span class="i3">Such a Progeny,</span>
<span class="i3">Such a State,</span>
<span class="i3">Such a Government,</span>
<span class="i3">So compleat and absolute;</span>
<span class="i3">That God approves:</span>
<span class="i3">The World admires:</span>
<span class="i0">All true English Hearts honour and reverence:</span>
<span class="i0">The Pope and his Disciples onely envies and maligns.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>The Sergeant, after dwelling briefly on the chief
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>points of the indictment, and describing the objects
of the conspiracy and the plan of the conspirators,
sat down to make way for the principal counsel for
the prosecution, His Majesty&#8217;s Attorney-General, Sir
Edward Coke.</p>

<p>Coke, the enemy of Bacon, was now about fifty-five,
and he had filled the post of Attorney-General
for nine years. Sir Everard Digby and his fellow-prisoners
knew that they had little mercy to expect
at his hands. The asperity which he had shown in
prosecuting Essex, five years earlier, and the personal
animosity which he had exhibited, still later, in his
sarcastic speech at the trial of Raleigh, when he had
wound up with the phrase, &#8220;Thou hast an English
face but a Spanish heart,&#8221; were notorious, and he
was certain to make such a trial as that of the
conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot the occasion of
a great forensic display. It so happened that his
speeches at this trial and that of Father Garnet,
which presently followed it, brought his career as
an advocate to a close; for within a year he was
appointed Chief-Justice of Common Pleas.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, his speeches at the trial of Sir
Everard Digby and his accomplices added to his
fame; but Jardine<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> called one of them &#8220;a long and
laboured harangue,&#8221; and other historians thought
him guilty of<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> &#8220;unnecessary cruelty in the torture
and gratuitous&#8221; insolence which he exhibited towards
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span>the accused. The glaring eyes, which we see represented
in his portrait, would be an unpleasant
prospect for Sir Everard as he listened to his cruel
words; but whatever tenderness a biographer may
feel for his subject, and whatever dislike a Catholic
may entertain to the Protestant bigotry of Sir
Edward Coke, it ought not to be forgotten that,
according to his lights, he was an honest, if a hard
and an unmerciful man, that some ten years later
he himself fell into disgrace and suffered imprisonment
in the Tower, rather than yield on a point of
principle, and that, vindictive as he could be in
prosecuting a prisoner, one of his enemies&mdash;Lord
Chancellor Egerton&mdash;said that his greatest fault was
his &#8220;excessive popularity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although he began his speech by saying that the
Gunpowder Plot had been the greatest treason ever
conceived against the greatest king that ever lived,
he had presently a complimentary word or two to
say as to the origins and previous lives of some of
the conspirators. With an air of great truthfulness
and fairness he said:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> &#8220;It is by some given out
that they are such men as admit just exception,
either desperate in estate, or base, or not settled in
their wits; such as are <i>sine religione, sine sede, sine
fide, sine re, et sine spe</i>&mdash;without religion, without
habitation, without credit, without means, without
hope. But (that no man, though never so wicked,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>may be wronged) true it is, they were gentlemen
of good houses, of excellent parts, howsoever most
perniciously seduced, abused, corrupted, and jesuited,
of very competent fortunes and estates.&#8221;</p>

<p>After having said these comparatively gentle
words concerning the laity, he launched forth in
declamation against &#8220;those of the spirituality,&#8221; not
one of whom was actually on his trial. &#8220;It is falsely
said,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that there is never a religious man
in this action; for I never yet knew a treason
without a Romish priest; but in this there are very
many Jesuits, who are known to have dealt and
passed through the whole action.&#8221; He then named
four of these, beginning with Father Garnet, &#8220;besides
their cursory men,&#8221; the first of which was Father
Gerard. &#8220;The studies and practises of this sect
principally consisted in two D&#8217;s, to wit, in deposing
of kings and disposing of kingdoms.&#8221; Having
thundered away at Jesuits and priests to his heart&#8217;s
content, he exclaimed that &#8220;the Romish Catholicks&#8221;
had put themselves under &#8220;Gunpowder Law, fit
for Justices of Hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Note,&#8221; said he, with great vehemence, &#8220;that
gunpowder was the invention of a Friar, one of
that Romish Rabble.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> &#8220;All friars, religions, and
priests were bad&#8221;; but &#8220;the principal offenders are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>the seducing Jesuits, men that use the reverence
of Religion, yea, even the most Sacred and Blessed
name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> as a mantle to cover their impiety,
blasphemy, treason, and rebellion, and all manner
of wickedness.&#8221;</p>

<p>No speech in those days was considered perfect
without a few words of astrology, so he called the
attention of the Court to the remarkable fact &#8220;that
it was in the entering of the Sun into the Tropick
of <i>Capricorn</i>, when they&#8221; [the conspirators] &#8220;began
their mine; noting that by mineing they should
descend, and by hanging ascend.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the latter part of his pompous harangue, there
was a passage which must have been very unpleasant
hearing to the prisoners, however interesting to the
rest of the audience.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The conclusion shall be from the admirable
clemency and moderation of the King, in that howsoever
these traitors have exceeded all others their
predecessors in mischief, and <i>Crescente, malitia
crescere debuit, etc., P&#339;na</i>; yet neither will the
King exceed the usual punishment of Law, nor invent
any new torture or torment for them, but is
graciously pleased to afford them an ordinary course
of trial, as an ordinary punishment, much inferior
to their offence.&#8221; Nor was this reference to a
&#8220;new torture&#8221; a mere figure of rhetoric on the
part of the Attorney-General; for a few days
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>earlier,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> in both houses of Parliament, a proposal had
been made to petition the King &#8220;to stay judgment
until Parliament should have time to consider some
extraordinary mode of punishment, which might surpass
in horror even the scenes which usually occurred
at the execution of traitors.&#8221; To their credit be it
spoken, this suggestion was negatived by both Lords
and Commons.</p>

<p>&#8220;And surely,&#8221; continued Coke, &#8220;worthy of observation
is the punishment by law provided for
High Treason, which we call <i>Crimen læsæ Majestatis</i>.
For first after a traitor hath had his fair trial, and
is convicted and attainted, he shall have his judgment
to be drawn to the place of execution from
his prison, as being not worthy any more to tread
upon the face of the earth, whereof he was made.
Also for that he hath been retrograde to Nature,
therefore is he drawn backwards at a horse-tail.
And whereas God hath made the head of man the
highest and most supreme part, as being his chief
grace and ornament: <i>Pronáque cum spectent
Animalia cætera terram, Os homini sublime dedit</i>;
he must be drawn with his head declining downward,
and lying so near the ground as may be, being
thought unfit to take benefit of the common air.
For which cause also he shall be strangled, being
hanged up by the neck between heaven and earth,
as deemed unworthy of both, or either; as likewise,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>that the eyes of men may behold, and their hearts
contemn him. Then is he to be cut down alive,
and to have &mdash;&mdash; cut off, and burnt before his face,
as being unworthily begotten, and unfit to leave
any generation after him; his bowels and inlayed
parts taken out and burnt, who inwardly conceived
and harboured in his heart such horrible Treason.
After, to have his head cut off, which had imagined
the mischief. And lastly, his body to be quartered,
and the quarters set up in some high and eminent
place, to the view and detestation of men, and to
become a prey for the Fouls of the Air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering that the prisoners had not yet been
found guilty, and that even had they been, it was no
business of his to pass sentence on them, this pointless
and objectless description of their probable fate was as
gratuitous as it was cruel on the part of the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>With the prisoners, other than Sir Everard Digby,
I have nothing to do, and it will suffice to say, that,
at the conclusion of the Attorney-General&#8217;s speech,
the depositions of their examinations in the Tower&mdash;&#8220;the
voluntary confessions of all the said several
traitors in writings subscribed with their own proper
hands&#8221;&mdash;were then read aloud. These are very
interesting, and have already been partially used in
framing the story in the preceding pages. They are
humble and penitent in tone, and as a specimen of
this apparent penitence I will quote the opening<span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>
of one of the longest, namely that by Thomas
Winter.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;My most honorable Lordes.&mdash;Not out of hope to
obtayne pardon, for speakinge of my temporall past,
I may say the fault is greater than can be forgiven,
nor affectinge hereby the title of a good subject, for I
must redeeme my countrey from as great a danger as
I have hazarded the bringinge her into, before I can
purchase any such opinion; only at your Ho. Commans
I will breifely sett downe my owne accusation, and
how farr I have proceeded in this busyness w<sup>ch</sup> I shall
the faythfuller doe since I see such courses are not
pleasinge to Allmighty God, and that all or the most
material parts have been allready confessed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>At the conclusion of the public reading of these
confessions, the Lord Chief Justice made some remarks
to the jury, and then directed them to consider
of their verdict; upon &#8220;which they retired into a
separate place.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was then arraigned by himself
upon a separate indictment issued by Sir Christopher
Yelverton and other special commissioners of Oyer &amp;
Terminer, on the 16th of January, at Wellingborough,
in Northamptonshire, and delivered to the same
commission in Middlesex that had tried the other
prisoners. It charged him with High Treason in
conspiring the death of the king, with conferring with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span>Catesby in Northamptonshire concerning the Gunpowder
Plot, assenting to the design, and taking the
oath of secrecy.</p>

<p>As soon as the indictment was read, Sir Everard
began to make a speech; but was interrupted by
being told that he must first plead, either guilty or
not guilty, and that then he would be allowed to say
what he liked.</p>

<p>He at once confessed that he was guilty of the
treason; and then he spoke of the motives which had led
him to it.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> The first of these was neither ambition,
nor discontent, nor ill-will towards any member of
Parliament, but his intense friendship and affection
for Robert Catesby, whose influence over him was so
great that he could not help risking his own property
and his life at his bidding. The second motive was
the cause of religion, on behalf of which he was glad to
endanger &#8220;his estate, his life, his name, his memory,
his posterity, and all worldly and earthly felicity
whatsoever.&#8221; His third motive was prompted by the
broken promises to Catholics, and had as its object
the prevention of the harder laws which they feared
and professed to have solid reasons for fearing, from
the new Parliament; as &#8220;that Recusant&#8217;s Wives, and
women, should be liable to the Mulct as well as their
husbands and men.&#8221; And further, that &#8220;it was
supposed, that it should be made a <i>Præmunire</i> onely
to be a Catholick.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>Having stated the motives of his crime, he proceeded
to make his petitions&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> &#8220;That sithens his
offence was confined and contained within himself,
that the punishment also of the same might extend
only to himself, and not be transferred either to his
Wife, Children, Sisters, or others: and therefore for
his Wife he humbly craved, that she might enjoy her
Joynture, his Son the benefit of an Entail made long
before any thought of this action; his Sisters, their
just and due portions which were in his hands; his
Creditors, their rightful Debts; which that he might
more justly set down under his hand, he requested,
that before his death, his Man (who was better
acquainted both with the men and the particulars than
himself) might be licensed to come unto him. Then
prayed he pardon of the King and Ll. for his guilt,
and lastly, he entreated to be beheaded, desiring all
men to forgive him, and that his death might satisfie
them for his trespass.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daylight was waning quickly in the great hall
of Westminster, on that short January day, when Sir
Edward Coke, the Attorney-General, rose from his
seat, at the conclusion of Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s dignified
but distressed speech. He had already shown refinement
of cruelty in treating the prisoners to a detailed
description of the horrors of the death that was awaiting
them, and he was now again ready to inflict as
much pain as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>As to Sir Everard&#8217;s friendship with Catesby, he
said, it was &#8220;mere folly, and wicked Conspiracy&#8221;;
his religion was &#8220;Error and Heresie&#8221;; his promises&mdash;it
does not appear that he had made any&mdash;were
&#8220;idle and vain presumptions&#8221;; &#8220;as also his fears,
false alarms, Concerning Wives that were Recusants.&#8221;
&#8220;If a man married one,&#8221; great reason there is, &#8220;that
he or they should pay for it&#8221;; but if a wife &#8220;were
no Recusant at the time of Marriage&#8221;&mdash;as had been
the case with Lady Digby, although he did not
mention her by name&mdash;&#8220;and yet afterwards he suffer
her to be corrupted and seduced, by admitting Priests
and Romanists into his house&#8221;&mdash;Roger Lee and
Father Gerard, for instance, Sir Everard might understand
him to imply&mdash;&#8220;good reason that he, be he
Papist or Protestant, should pay for his negligence
and misgovernment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next he dealt with Sir Everard&#8217;s petitions on behalf
of his wife, children, sisters, &amp;c., and on this point
he became eloquent.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> &#8220;Oh how he doth now put
on the bowels of Nature and Compassion in the perils
of his private and domesticated estate! But before,
when the publick state of his Countrey, when the
King, the Queen, the tender Princes, the Nobles, the
whole Kingdom, were designed to a perpetual destruction,
Where was then this piety, this Religious
affection?&#8221; &#8220;All Nature, all Humanity, all respect
of Laws both Divine and Humane, were quite
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>abandoned; then there was no conscience made to
extirpate the whole Nation, and all for a pretended
zeal to the Catholick Religion, and the justification
of so detestable and damnable a Fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Sir Everard Digby interrupted the great
lawyer with the remark that he had not justified
the fact, but had confessed that he deserved the
vilest death; and that all he had done was to seek
mercy, &#8220;and some moderation of justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to moderation of justice, replied the Attorney-General,
how could a man expect or ask for it who
had acted in direct opposition to all mercy and all
justice? And had he not already had most ample and
most undeserved moderation shown to him? Verily
he ought &#8220;to admire the great moderation and mercy
of the King, in that, for so exorbitant a crime, no
new torture answerable thereunto was devised to be
inflicted upon him.&#8221; Was it not sufficient consolation
to him to reflect upon his good fortune in this respect?
Sir Everard had talked about his wife and children.
Well! did he forget how he had said &#8220;that for the
Catholick Cause he was content to neglect the ruine of
himself, his Wife, his Estate, and all&#8221;? Oh! he should
be made content enough on this point. Here was an
appropriate text for him:&mdash;&#8220;Let his Wife be a widow,
and his Children vagabonds, let his posterity be
destroyed, and in the next generation let his name be
quite put out.&#8221; Then Sir Edward Coke spoke directly
to Sir Everard, and said:&mdash;&#8220;For the paying of your<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>
Creditors, it is equal and just, but yet fit the King be
first satisfied and paid, to whom you owe so much, as
that all you have is too little: yet these things must
be left to the pleasure of his Majesty, and the course
of Justice and Law.&#8221; Fortunately for Sir Everard,
&#8220;in respect for the time (for it grew now dark)&#8221; the
Attorney General spoke &#8220;very briefly.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the nine Commissioners, appointed to try
the prisoners, now addressed Sir Everard. His words
came with more force, perhaps it might be said with
more cruel force, because he was himself a Catholic.
This was Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, younger
brother of the Duke of Norfolk, and second son of
Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, who had been beheaded
on Tower Hill, nearly sixty years earlier, in
the reign of Henry VIII. This Commissioner had
espoused the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and he
was rather ostentatiously put forward at this trial, and
afterwards at that of Father Garnet, to prove his
loyalty and to counteract the jealousy and suspicion
which had been caused by the appointment of a man
of his religion<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> to the Wardenship of the Cinque
Ports. Banks wrote of him,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> &#8220;other authors represent
him as the most contemptible and despicable of man-kind;
a wretch, that it causes astonishment to reflect,
that he was the son of the generous, the noble, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>accomplished Earl of Surrey.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> He was a learned man,
but a pedant, dark and mysterious, and consequently
far from possessing masterly abilities. He was the
grossest of flatterers, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>Northampton began his speech as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>&#8220;You must not hold it strange, Sir Everard Digby,
though at this time being pressed in duty, Conscience
and Truth, I do not suffer you to wander in the Laberinth
of your own idle conceits without opposition, to
seduce others, as your self have been seduced, by false
Principles; or to convey your self by charms of imputation,
by clouds of errour, and by shifts of lately devised
&#8216;Equivocation&#8217;; out of that streight wherein your
late secure and happy fortune hath been unluckily
entangled; but yet justly surprised, by the rage and
revenge of your own rash humors. If in this crime
(more horrible than any man is able to express) I could
lament the estate of any person upon earth, I could
pity you, but thank your self and your bad counsellours,
for leading you into a Crime of such a kind; as no less
benummeth in all faithfull, true and honest men, the
tenderness of affection, than it did in you, the sense of
all humanity. That you were once well thought of,
and esteemed by the late Queen, I can witness, having
heard her speak of you with that grace which might
have encouraged a true gentleman to have run a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>better course: Nay, I will add further, that there was a
time, wherein you were as well affected to the king
our master&#8217;s expectation, though perhaps upon false
rumours and reports, that he would have yielded satisfaction
to your unprobable and vast desires: but the
seed that wanted moisture (as our Saviour Himself
reporteth) took no deep root: that zeal which hath
no other end or object than the pleasing of it self, is
quickly spent: and Trajan, that worthy and wise
Emperour, had reason to hold himself discharged of
all debts to those, that had offended more by prevarication,
than they could deserve by industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The main contention of his long and wordy
speech was to refute the charge of broken promises
to his co-religionists brought by Sir Everard Digby
in his description of his motives. It was well-known
that the Catholics considered the king guilty
of perfidy on this point, and that they based their
accusation chiefly upon the reports of Father
Watson&#8217;s celebrated interview with James in Scotland,
a matter with which I dealt in an early
chapter. Northampton denied that James had ever
encouraged the Catholics to expect any favour.</p>

<p>He made a strong point of Percy&#8217;s having asserted
that the king had promised toleration to the
Catholics; asking why, if this were really the case,
Percy, at the beginning of the king&#8217;s reign, thought
it worth while to employ Guy Fawkes and others
to plot against the king in Spain? He wound<span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>
up by praying for Sir Everard&#8217;s repentance in this
world and his forgiveness in the next.</p>

<p>Then Lord Salisbury spoke. He began by acknowledging
his own connection, by marriage, with
Sir Everard, and then he proceeded, with even
greater zeal than Northampton, to imply that the
prisoner&#8217;s plea of broken promises to Catholics
would be understood to mean bad faith on the part
of the king; and it was thought by some that Sir
Everard would have had his sentence commuted
for beheading, had it not been for what Salisbury
now said.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> After defending the king from all imputation
of faithlessness towards his Catholic subjects,
Salisbury referred to Sir Everard&#8217;s personal guilt,
and dwelt upon Guy Fawkes&#8217;s evidence that, at
Gothurst, he had <ins title="Original word expresssd"><a href="#TN">expressed</a></ins> a fear lest the gunpowder
stored beneath the houses of Parliament,
might, during the wet weather in October, have
&#8220;grown dank.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Salisbury had finished, Sergeant Philips
got up and &#8220;prayed the judgment of the court
upon the verdict of the Jury against the seven
first prisoners, and against Sir Everard Digby upon
his own confession.&#8221; Each prisoner was then
formally asked what he had to say why judgment
of death should not be pronounced against him.
Finally Lord Chief Justice Popham described and
defended the laws made by Queen Elizabeth against
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>priests, recusants, and receivers and harbourers of
priests,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> which seems to have been a little wide
of the subject of the crime of the prisoners, and
then he solemnly pronounced the usual sentence
for high treason upon all the eight men who stood
convicted before him.</p>

<p>Then Sir Everard bowed towards the commissioners
who had tried him and said:&mdash;&#8220;If I may but hear
any of your Lordships say you forgive me, I shall
go more cheerfully to the gallows.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all immediately replied:&mdash;&#8220;God forgive
you, and we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus, late in the evening, this memorable
trial ended, and the prisoners were conveyed by
torches to their barge; then they were rowed down
the river to the Tower, and led through the dark
&#8220;Traitor&#8217;s Gate&#8221; to their cells.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was only allowed two clear days
between his trial and his execution to prepare for
death. He was not permitted to see his young wife
or his little sons, nor was he granted the consolation
of the services of a priest. Short as was the time
he had yet to live, it must have hung heavily on his
hands. Fortunately he had lived much with Jesuits,
who would doubtless have instructed him in their
admirable system of meditation; but &#8220;the exercise
of the memory,&#8221; which it includes, can hardly have
afforded him much consolation under the circumstances.
To add to his depression, it was at the time
of year when there are but few hours of daylight,
and the artificial light permitted in a prisoner&#8217;s
room in the Tower would certainly be very meagre,
and little more than sufficient to render the ghastly
gloom of the dungeon-walls more manifest. Very
early, too, all prisoners&#8217; lights would be put out, and
terrible then must have been the dreariness of the
long nights and the dark mornings, until the sun
rose at about a quarter to eight o&#8217;clock. It is easy
to imagine him dreaming of his happy home at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>
Gothurst, and fancying himself walking with his
wife in its garden, or playing with his little
children by its great hall fireside, or entertaining
his guests at its long banquetting-table, and
suddenly waking with a start, to find himself in
darkness, on a hard bed, with a rough, cold wall
beside him, and to remember that he was a condemned
traitor in the Tower of London; and then,
perhaps, lying awake to reflect upon the brilliant
opportunities of happiness, prosperity, and usefulness
with which he had started in his short life,
and the misery in which he was about to end it.
Nor does it require any great effort of the imagination
to see him falling, from sheer weariness, into
a fitful, feverish sleep, and, as he turned and tossed,
frequently dreaming of the horrors of his impending
execution, as they had been so lately described
in his presence by the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>When, in the morning, he rose to obtain consolation
from devotion, how likely that the heavy drowsiness
or headache resulting from a wretched night would
make him feel utterly helpless as he tried to pray
or meditate; or that, distracted by the memories of
his misfortunes, and the terrible thought of the
destitution to which his wife and family might be
exposed&mdash;for he seems to have died in doubt whether
Gothurst, as well as his estates inherited from his
father, would not be confiscated&mdash;he would be unable
to fix his attention upon spiritual matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>During the interval preceding his death Sir Everard
wrote the following lines. Criticise them as you
please; call them doggrel if you will; but at least
respect them as the words of a broken-hearted and
dying man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="title">JESUS MARIA.</p>
<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who&#8217;s that which knocks? Oh stay, my Lord, I come:</span>
<span class="i1">I know that call, since first it made me know</span>

<span class="i1">Lest He be gone that can my duty show.</span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">My tears shall water where thy shine doth threat.</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>However deeply Sir Everard Digby may have
sinned, he knew how to make his peace with God
when death approached him. He had a definite
religion to depend on, he had no need to consider which
of many widely divergent views held by the professors
of one nominal church was the most probable. It is
true that he was deprived of those consoling rites which
the Catholic Church provides for her children when on
the threshold of death; he had none of the &#8220;soothing
charm&#8221; of &#8220;the words of peace and blessing&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> uttered
by the confessor in absolution; he was not strengthened
for the perilous journey from this life to the next by the
sacred viaticum, but he knew that, where these privileges
could not be obtained, a hearty desire for them,
with a good act of contrition, might obtain many of
their blessings and all that was necessary for salvation.</p>

<p>From a theological point of view, it was a happy
thing that he knew the plot in which he had been
implicated to be all but universally condemned by
his co-religionists. If many of them had defended it,
and he had heard that there were two parties, one
extenuating the conspiracy and another anathematising
it, he might have clung to the belief that he had
done nothing wrong, and that &#8220;rending of the heart&#8221;
conducive to true contrition might have been wanting.</p>

<p>He had sinned deeply; let us hope that deep
was his sorrow. Yet is not this the moment&mdash;the
moment when we are supposing him in the deepest
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span>degradation of spirit for his iniquities&mdash;at which we
may best say a kind word for him?</p>

<p>Hitherto I have written little in palliation of his
crime; perhaps the very fact of his having professed
my own religion may have made me more careful to
say nothing that might have the appearance of
minimising his guilt; nor, in the few more pages that
I have still to write, do I intend to plead that his
sentence ought to have been commuted on account of
any extenuating circumstances. Unquestionably he
deserved to die, but I beg to commend his memory
to the mercy of my readers.</p>

<p>Let others speak for him. The Protestant Bishop
Barlow, in his book on the Gunpowder Plot, which so
severely condemns all concerned in it, says<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;This
Gentleman was verily persuaded of the lawfulness of
this Design, and did engage in it out of a sincere, but
ignorant zeal for the advancement, as he thought, of
the true Religion.&#8221; These are the words of a hostile
historian: the following&mdash;some of which have been
quoted earlier&mdash;are those of a friend<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;He was so
much and so generally lamented, and is so much
esteemed and praised by all sorts in England, both
Catholics and others, although neither side can or do
approve this last outrageous and exorbitant attempt
against our King and country, wherein a man otherwise
so worthy, was so unworthily lost and cast away
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>to the great grief of all that knew him, and especially
of all that loved him. And truly it was hard to do
the one and not the other.&#8221; An unfriendly critic,
Scott, in a footnote to the <i>Somers&#8217; Tracts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> says that
Sir Everard &#8220;was a man of unblemished reputation
until this hellish conspiracy.&#8221; Yet another, Caulfield,
says of him,<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> &#8220;Digby himself was as highly esteemed
and beloved as any man in England&#8221;; and one more
hostile writer, Jardine, says<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>:&mdash;&#8220;There is abundant
evidence that Sir Everard Digby joined in the enterprise
under the full persuasion that in so doing he
was rendering good service to his church and promoting
the cause of true religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Testimonies to his character would be incomplete
without any from a woman. Here is one from a
Protestant to the back-bone, Miss Aikin:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> &#8220;His
youth, his personal graces, the constancy which he
had exhibited whilst he believed himself a martyr
in a good cause, the deep sorrow which he testified
on becoming sensible of his error, seemed to have
moved all hearts with pity and even admiration;
and if so detestable a villainy as the powder plot
may be permitted to have a hero, Everard Digby
was undoubtedly the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lastly, he must be allowed to have his share in the
fair and considerate pleadings of the greatest of all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 295]</span>historians of the Stuart period, on behalf of the
conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot. Dr Samuel
Rawson Gardiner writes:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> &#8220;Atrocious as the whole
undertaking was, great as must have been the moral
obliquity of their minds before they could have conceived
such a project, there was at least nothing
mean or selfish about them. They had boldly risked
their lives for what they honestly believed to be
the cause of God and of their country.&#8221; A few
lines further on he says, &#8220;if the criminality of their
design was hidden from the eyes of the plotters, it
was not from any ambitious thoughts of the consequences
of success to themselves.&#8221; Presently he
adds, &#8220;As far as we can judge, they would have
been ready, as soon as the wrongs of which they
complained had been redressed, to sink back again
into obscurity.&#8221; And finally, after dwelling upon
their difficulty in seeing &#8220;their atrocious crime in
the light in which we see it,&#8221; he declares his opinion
that, just at last, at least some of them saw &#8220;their
acts as they really were,&#8221; and &#8220;with such thoughts
as these on their minds,&#8221; &#8220;passed away from the
world which they had wronged to the presence of Him
who had seen their guilt and their repentance alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is well, however, to be just as well as generous,
and if it be impossible to consider the fine, handsome
youth, of four and twenty, awaiting execution in
the Tower of London, without feelings of compassion;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>we should none the less remember that Sir Everard
Digby&#8217;s co-religionists have other reasons for sorrow
in connection with him. Instead of benefiting
the Catholic cause in his country by the enterprise
which he assisted with his influence, his wealth,
his time, and his personal services, he did it
the most serious mischief conceivable; we must
keep before our minds, therefore, the fact, that to
Catholics he should appear, not so much an unhappy
failure, as a most active, if most unintentional,
aggressor. Although King James himself
declared that the English Catholics, as a body,
were neither implicated in, nor approvers of the
Gunpowder Plot; although the Archpriest condemned
it formally a day or two after its discovery;
although Father Gerard and other Jesuits
distinctly and categorically disclaimed all connection
with it, and although the Pope himself addressed
two letters to King James, expressing his unqualified
horror of it, the idea was never dispelled that it
was a Popish and Jesuitical design. For many
years, English people were ready to believe any
absurd tale of Catholic conspiracy, such as<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> &#8220;Rome&#8217;s
Master-piece: or, The Grand Conspiracy of the Pope
and his Jesuited Instruments,&#8221; in 1640, and the
pretended plot to assassinate Charles II. in 1678,
for which, on the perjured evidence of Titus Oates
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>and others,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> &#8220;about eighteen Roman Catholics were
accused, and upon false testimony convicted and
executed; among them the aged Viscount Stafford.&#8221;
Ballads, such as that which begins as follows, describing
this so-called and non-existent conspiracy,
were eagerly purchased in the streets.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> &#8220;Good People, I pray you, give ear unto me,</span>
<span class="i2">A Story so strange you have never been told,</span>
<span class="i1">How the <i>Jesuit</i>, <i>Devil</i>, and <i>Pope</i> did agree</span>
<span class="i2">Our <i>State</i> to destroy, and <i>Religion so old</i>.</span>
<span class="i5">To <i>murder</i> our <i>King</i>,</span>
<span class="i5">A most horrible thing, &amp;c.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>Nor did the prejudices against Catholics raised by
the Gunpowder Plot, early in the seventeenth
century, die out at the end of it. Even now
there remains a traditional superstition in this
country that it was planned by the Jesuits, admired
by the majority of English Catholics, and secretly
connived at by the Pope and the Sacred College.
For generations, English schoolboys have believed
that Roman Catholics are people who would blow
up every Protestant with gunpowder if they could.
So indelible has been the prejudice created against
Catholics by the misdoings of a mere handful of
conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot, that the large
number of English Catholic squires, baronets, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>noblemen, who squandered their estates and their
patrimony, and even gave their lives, for their king,
in the reigns of Charles I. and Charles II., failed to
eradicate the popular notion that all Catholics were disloyal.
The meetings at White Webbs and Gothurst
gave rise to the idea that the private house of
every Catholic served as a rendezvous for plotters,
and every seminary as a nest of traitors; the fact
that Catesby and Digby had Jesuit friends has made
Protestants believe that every Jesuit would commit
a murder if he thought it would serve the cause
of his religion; and the fact that they had priests
in their houses has led to the impression that, wherever
there is a domestic Catholic chaplain, mischief
is certain to be brewing. Worst of all, when Protestants
are told of &#8220;an excellent Catholic,&#8221; a man
who goes to confession and communion every week,
a man of irreproachable character both in private
and in public life, a man of high position, great
wealth, charming manners, and popularity among
Protestants as well as Catholics, they can point,
as they have been able to point for nearly three
hundred years, to the history of Sir Everard Digby,
as an example of what even such a man would be
&#8220;obliged to do&#8221; were &#8220;his priest&#8221; so to order him.</p>

<p>Thus much for the moral effect produced by the
efforts of Sir Everard Digby and his friends for
the benefit of the English Catholics; the material
effect may be described in a few words. It was,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>
instead of relieving them from oppression, to cause
the laws and disabilities under which they suffered to
be redoubled. When they reflect upon all these things,
can Catholics recall the memory of Sir Everard
Digby with no other feelings than those of pity?
Surely, if any class of men have cause to execrate
the memory of every conspirator in the Gunpowder
Plot, it is not the Protestants but the Catholics.</p>

<p>None the less may it be doubted, whether, among
misguided men, there is a character in history more
to be pitied than Sir Everard Digby. Whatever
his faults, whatever his errors, whatever the mischief
he wrought to the cause for which he was ready
to give his life, he never seems to have been guilty
of a selfish action; if he was disloyal to his country,
he believed that he was serving its best interests;
if he mistook atrocious murder for legitimate warfare,
it was with the hope of restoring his fellow-countrymen
to the faith of their forefathers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inhabitants of London were to have two
thoroughly happy days; there was to be a great
execution on Thursday and another on Friday.
Four traitors were to be hanged, drawn, and
quartered on either day.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 30th of January 1606, Sir
Everard Digby was taken from his prison in the
Tower to a doorway in front of which four horses were
each harnessed to a separate wattled hurdle lying on<span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>
the ground. He found three of his fellow-conspirators
awaiting him&mdash;his late host, Robert Winter of Huddington,
the courageous, but rough and pugnacious, John
Grant of Norbrook, and&mdash;there being no respect of persons
on the scaffold&mdash;Thomas Bates, Catesby&#8217;s servant.</p>

<p>Ordered to lie down on his back, with his head
towards the horse&#8217;s tail, Sir Everard was tightly
bound to the hurdle, and when all the four condemned
men had been treated in the same manner,
the procession started on its doleful journey. To
be dragged through the muddy streets of London,
to be splashed and saturated with their slush and
filth, and to be bruised and shaken over the rough
stones as the hurdle rose and fell over them, must
have been as disagreeable as it was degrading; and
the mile or more from the Tower to the place of
execution&mdash;the west of St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral&mdash;was a
long distance over which to be submitted to such
an ordeal. To add to the sensations of disgrace, the
streets were crowded, and nearly every window in
Cheapside was filled with people watching the
prisoners passing to their doom.</p>

<p>Every pains had been taken to render the execution
as imposing as possible. A large number of
soldiers accompanied the procession, and the Lord
Mayor had issued an order to the Alderman of each
ward of the city, ordering him to<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> &#8220;cause one able
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>and sufficient person, with a halbard in his hand,
to stand at the door of every several dwelling-house
in the open street in the way that the traitors were
to be drawn towards the place of execution, from
seven in the morning until the return of the sheriff.&#8221;
This was partly with a view to add dignity and
importance to the terrible function, and partly to
provide against tumult or raids by the mob.</p>

<p>When the shadow of St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral fell upon
his hurdle, Sir Everard knew that he was very near
the scene of his execution; the crowd became greater
at every step of the horse that was dragging him,
and he had scarcely passed the great church before
he found himself in a narrow lane formed by a
densely packed mass of people, kept apart by a
line of soldiers on either side.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horse that was drawing his hurdle
stopped, and, on looking up, he saw the ghastly
gallows by his side. There, also, was the long,
low, thick table, or block, on which the quartering
would take place; there, too, were the preparations
for the fire in which certain portions of his body
would be burnt before it went out.</p>

<p>He was liberated from the hurdle. Stiff and mud-bespattered,
he got up and was led towards the
gallows. He was then informed that he was to be
the first to suffer. Many officials were present.
The protestant clergy came forward and offered
their services. He courteously refused them; but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>
turning to the crowd, he begged the assistance and
prayers of all good Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Even his enemies
admitted that as he stood on the scaffold, he was<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
&#8220;a man of a goodly personage and a manly aspect,&#8221;
although &#8220;his colour grew pale,&#8221; as well it might,
after having been dragged on his back for a mile
over the streets of that period; nor could a man be
expected to carry much colour on his face immediately
before being put to a horrible death in cold blood.</p>

<p>After saying a few prayers, he again turned to the
people, and one of the officials asked him to acknowledge
his treason before he died. He then made a
short speech.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>&#8220;Sir Everard Digby&#8221; says Stow, &#8220;protested from
the bottome of his heart, he asked forgivenesse of God,
the King, the Queene, the Prince, and all the Parliament,
and if that hee had knowne it at first to have
ben so foule a treason, he would not have concealed it
to have gayned a world, requiring the people to
witnesse he died penitent and sorrowfull for this vile
Treason, and confident to be saved in the merits of his
sweet Saviour Jesus, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, he declared most solemnly<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> that while he was
quite willing to die for his offence, he had not been
impelled to commit the treason by feelings of ill-will
towards any living creature, or a desire for self-advancement
or worldly gains. His sole motive had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>been to put an end to the persecutions of Catholics, to
benefit human souls, and to serve the cause of religion.
The action itself he acknowledged to have been sinful;
the intentions which prompted it he protested to
have been pure.</p>

<p>&#8220;His speech was not long,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and, when it was
ended he knelt down, made the sign of the Cross, and
said some prayers in a low voice in Latin, &#8220;often
bowing his head to the ground,&#8221; says Stow,
&#8220;mumbling to himself,&#8221; and &#8220;refusing to have any
prayers of any but of the Romish Catholics,&#8221; says the
hostile historian in the <i>Somers&#8217; Tracts</i>, he &#8220;fell to his
prayers with such devotion as moved all the beholders,&#8221;
states his friend Father Gerard, who goes on to say:&mdash;&#8220;And
when he had done, he stood up and saluted all the
noblemen and gentlemen that stood upon the scaffold,
every one according to his estate, to the noblemen with
a lower <i>congé</i>, to others with more show of equality, but
to all in so friendly and so cheerful a manner, as they
afterwards said, he seemed so free from fear of death,
as that he showed no feeling at all of any passion
therein, but took his leave of them as he was wont to
do when he went from the Court or out of the city to
his own house in the country; yet he showed so great
devotion of mind, so much fervour and humility in his
prayers, and so great confidence in God, as that very
many said<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> they made no doubt but his soul was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span>happy, and wished themselves might die in the like
state of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hangman now came up to assist him in his
preparations for execution. Before going to the
gallows for hanging and quartering, the condemned
man was stripped, with the exception of his shirt.
This humiliating process having been completed, with
his hands bound, Sir Everard accompanied the executioner
to the foot of the ladder, and saying, &#8220;Oh!
Jesu, Jesu, save me and keep me,&#8221; he ascended it,
as also did the hangman.</p>

<p>I should like to let the curtain fall here; but, were
I to do so, my story would be incomplete.</p>

<p>The punishment of hanging, drawing, and quartering
was so horrible, that it was often mitigated by
allowing the victim to hang until he was dead. This
might well have been done in the case of Sir Everard
Digby. To be hung, partially naked, knowing that
his body would afterwards be hacked to pieces in the
most disgraceful manner before the eyes of an
immense concourse of people, should have been considered
a sufficient punishment. But no! Not even
was he permitted to be to some extent stupefied by
being half-strangled. The executioner had no sooner
turned him off the ladder than he cut the rope.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Sir
Everard &#8220;fell on his face and bruised his forehead.&#8221;
Then followed a scene of vivisection and butchery,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]<span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span></a>
which would not be tolerated in these days if the
subject were a sheep or an ox. Yet even on the
awful block, Sir Everard never betrayed his dignity;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
and, condemn his offences as we may, we cannot
fairly refuse to give him credit for having died like
a good Christian, a courteous gentleman, and a
courageous Englishman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No biographer ever felt more genuine sorrow for
his subject than have I for Sir Everard Digby. My
sympathy for him has been the greater because he
was, like myself, a convert to the Roman Catholic
Church; because both he and I were received into
that Church by Fathers of the Society of Jesus;
because, both in his house and in mine, Jesuits have
very frequently been welcomed as guests, and because
in my private chapel, as in his, they have often acted
as chaplains. Moreover, an additional bond between
Sir Everard Digby and myself is the fact that he was
my ancestor. Nevertheless, I hope that I have not
allowed any of these accidents of faith or family to
induce me wilfully to conceal an incident important
to his history, to gloss over a mistake that he committed,
to put a dishonest construction upon one of
his actions, or to say an untrue word either about
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>himself, or any other character that has been introduced
among these pages. Like his own life, my
attempt at recounting it may be disfigured by mistaken
zeal, false inferences, and rash conclusions; or
possibly my authorities, like his friends, may have
led me into error; if so, before laying down my pen,
like Sir Everard Digby, before laying down his life,
let me admit the offence, but declare that it was
prompted by no unworthy motive.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
